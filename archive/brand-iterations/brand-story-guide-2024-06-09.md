# <a id="_eyul9cvkf11a"></a>BEINGS : BRAND STORY GUIDE

This is a Brand Story Guide\. It contains a number of truths about the brand, some set in stone rules and some building blocks for content\.

## <a id="_t9hkhjampriv"></a>Archetypes & Attributes

*Try to use language that relates to one of both of these as frequently as possible to solidify a brand in memory\. Archetypes are more concrete, attributes more abstract\.*

### <a id="_df86uowd3c4n"></a>Archetypes

__Destination \- Primary__

Destination brands are associated with a place\. Somewhere you have to go to consume the brand\. This could be a physical or virtual place, the key idea is that you mainly experience the brand there\.

Examples of how it might be used in copy:

- Beings is where research gets done\. 
- Beings is the place to quant your qual research\. 
- Away from the lab\.
- Analyse all of your research in one place\.

__Ingredient \- Secondary__

An ingredient brand exists as part of something bigger; it makes the process or host brand more powerful when it’s included\. Customers are likely to pay more when this ingredient is included\. 

Examples of how it might be used in copy:

- The centre of your research strategy\.
- Empowers / extends / augments / opens up\.
- An integral part of the research toolkit

- Research from any source

__Performance \- Secondary__

Performance brands can be *relied* *on* to offer a better experience, product or service\. The brand needs to provide a better experience every time\.

## <a id="_9cxm5tcqkogs"></a>Why, How, What

__Why: __To open up the field of qualitative research to anyone, better research means better decisions; better decisions mean better lives\.

__How:__ Use Human Intelligence \+ Machine Intelligence combined with a remote video recording platform\.

__What: __A platform underpinned by AI to enable researchers and analysts to design, deliver and code research from anywhere, at scale and speed\. 

## <a id="_e67bjxqcjkbd"></a>THE BIG LINE

\*

Core points to communicate:

- Beings enables “real” research that provides answers, not guesses
- Anyone can create a research project, deliver and code the results
- Research can be gathered anywhere
- Results are gathered quickly, if not almost real time
- Beings is not your dad’s way of doing research
- All the kruft is cut away with Beings

__Real research\. From everywhere\. Fast\.__

*Real research* \- hangs other research as not real \(i\.e\. not trustworthy\) and emphasises humanness\. \[Performance\]

*From everywhere* \- combines the multiple meanings of anyone / any department / any source / any geography / any place to do the research\. \[Destination, Accessibility\]

*Fast* \- a concrete fact expressed in informal, non stuffy language\. \[Performance\]

Specifically omitted is any mention of AI, machine learning etc as it’s effectively redundant as of 2024 \(because everything is powered by AI\)\. 

## <a id="_xqchbt18fjfk"></a>

## <a id="_qunqh784sri5"></a>Key Blurb

Your research should not deliver a hypothesis to test\. It should give you answers you can trust\. And it should do it fast\.

Beings, powered by Aida, lets anyone conduct in situ qualitative research in real time anywhere in the world\. Real answers at scale, from across your whole audience \- not just handfuls of candidates\.

Beings uses AI intelligently, to amplify the capabilities of humans where it counts\. Timelines for planning and understanding a research project are dramatically reduced, vast quantities of unstructured data are analysed without bias\. 

The result \- knowledge you can trust and act on fast\.

## <a id="_lgo7ecbp0kwe"></a>Snappy Descriptor

__The place to do qualitative, real time* *market research at *scale* across your whole audience by amplifying human intelligence with our AI Moderated Flow and cloud based video labs\. __

__AI Moderated Flow: __this is to create a sense of IP around the Beings process to encompass the circular design/deliver/code methodology that has AI Moderation threaded throughout\. IP branding gives the building blocks to speak about how Beings works as an end to end system\.

## <a id="_7qt1ph9s36t3"></a>Bad Descriptors, do not use

- Any kind of ‘agency’ language suggesting that Beings is more than a platform
- Democratising anything

## <a id="_x2by7m8ix7vb"></a>Beings Brand Promise

This is what a perfect client might say after a perfect interaction with your perfect brand\.

“Conducting my research with Beings gets smoother and faster each time I do it\. I can plan a project faster without worrying I’m missing something and conduct qualitative research across my entire audience anywhere in the world\. I can see the actual interactions as they happen thanks to the platform and finally code the results\. Basically, I can research at any scale I want and combine results from everywhere into a trusted output\. No more guessing\.”

## <a id="_r3vrw490b5wa"></a>Tone of Voice

__Suit and tie__ \- our audience is enterprises\. We’re also discussing something completely new, which means we need to speak in plain, easy to understand words\. 

With a good __sprinkle of punk__ \- we’re disrupting an industry so our voice needs to reflect that\. 

Be honest, even if it means ruffling a few feathers\.

__Language__: Use clear, direct language\. Avoid complex jargon, but if there’s an opportunity to show we know what the world of market research is like, take it\. 

Them: “Provide bespoke ad\-hoc research, or integrate our research in your own solutions or service offering”

Beings: “Research how you want, where you want and at the scale you want\.”

__Style Guidelines__

__Formal but Edgy: __Write in a polished, grammatically correct style but include edgy, unconventional elements to keep readers interested\.

__Assertive Tone:__ Speak with authority and conviction\. Make definitive statements rather than hedging or using passive language\.

__Visual Imagery:__ When describing concepts, use vivid, impactful imagery\. If something can be better said with an image or video, it should be\. 

__Do:__

Be direct and confident\.

Mix formal language with unexpected words or phrasing\.

Use the active voice to convey energy and action\.

__Don't:__

Use overly casual or slang language\.

Be overly aggressive or confrontational\.

Dilute the message with unnecessary fluff or filler\.

Fall back into lab\-marketing\-tech speak
