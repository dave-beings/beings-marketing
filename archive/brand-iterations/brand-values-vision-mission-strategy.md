# <a id="_ecswjg78iv5d"></a>Strategy

## <a id="_cvvqpock6z7q"></a>Diagnosis:

\- In research settings, administrative tasks divert significant time from core research work, limiting productivity and innovation\. Teams also face delays analysing data and aligning on objectives\.  

\- In product development, high\-quality discovery like user interviews is resource heavy, restricting its impact\. New asynchronous testing enables scale but reduces insight richness\.

\- Manual workflows, data and team misalignments, and suboptimal resource allocation slow down research and product outcomes\.  

\- Development costs are dropping with AI but discovery costs remain steady, reducing its influence on product strategy\.

## <a id="_m7o4bfpf4r9l"></a>Guiding Policy:  

\- Leverage AI to reinvent workflows for greater automation, insight depth, and team alignment\. Make high\-fidelity discovery efficient and integrated to drive innovation velocity\. Guide adoption via ethical AI that focuses on user needs\.

## <a id="_5v8mcd95d9zv"></a>Coherent Actions: 

1\. Prioritise AI tools for data visualisation, predictive analytics, and workflow automation based on user needs\.

2\. Implement NLP for automated content analysis and stakeholder alignment\. 

3\. Create integrated research repositories, leveraging predictive analytics to highlight gaps\.

4\. Provide customised semantic search, notifications, and natural language interfaces for self\-service access\. 

5\. Support end\-to\-end workflows from recruiting to analysis using AI assistance\.

6\. Develop proprietary natural language models tuned on industry data to enhance abilities\. 

7\. Establish ethical frameworks, extensive training programs, and gather continuous user feedback\.

8\. Architect for autonomy and interoperability by building own models instead of relying solely on public LLMs\.

In summary, the diagnosis identifies friction points in research and product development, the policy aims to apply AI to enhance workflow efficiency and insight quality, and the actions seek to make high\-fidelity discovery integrated, customizable and accessible to teams through responsible and needs\-based AI solutions\.

# <a id="_15ztg15xw29f"></a>Why is Beings a winning team?

Change starts with understanding people\. 

Our journey began through a collaboration with Google\. They asked the Beings team to redefine the future of research\. So, we transformed how over 1,500 researchers engage with and understand real people\. 

The Beings team builds empathetic AI video technology \- driven by an unstoppable hunger to help people understand each other in order to make better decisions\. 

We are fascinated by the human condition \- why people do what they do\. This spirit of inquiry remains our competitive fire, as we uncover what customers want but cannot yet articulate\. We shape change rather than bend to it, guided by understanding\.

The Beings team has an audacious vision \- to have 1 in 10 of the Global 2000 use our human insights platform, by 2030, to improve their customer experiences\. Companies that get closer to their customers' experiences will be the ones that thrive\. We're on a mission to make understanding people simpler and richer than ever\.

Technology at Beings isn’t just about algorithms and data; it’s about forging shared understanding and empathy between people\. We turn disconnected data points into useful insights, uplifting everyone involved\. Our commitment to progress powered by humanity is unwavering\. This ethos is what makes us an unquestionably winning team – we're not just creating technology; we're humanising the way the world connects\.

If technology lacks empathy, progress lacks meaning\.

# <a id="_t3n1llvu3r1g"></a>Problem

- 
	1. Customer research remains a manual, expensive, and siloed function at most large companies\. Legacy approaches fail to meet the pace, scale, and intimacy required to deeply understand evolving consumers\.
	2. Key issues include:
	3. Slow Speed: Traditional market research techniques average over 6 months per study
	4. High Costs: Custom consulting projects can cost over $250k per qualitative study
	5. Low Scale: In\-person focus groups capped at handfuls of consumers
	6. Weak Data Utility: Survey fatigue yields unreliable quantitative insights
	7. Lack of Empathy: Static data fails to build genuine human connections
	8. As customers grow more complex, competitive differentiation will come from truly knowing their hearts and minds\. But current organizational structures and outdated methodologies make this nearly impossible:
	9. 83% of operations and insights teams feel obstructed by internal complexities and politics
	10. 72% of researchers say they struggle to extract meaning from data
	11. Only 29% of CMOs believe they effectively act on insights
	12. Ultimately, businesses fail to gather enough relevant and neutral information\. They miss emerging trends, lose touch with changing needs, and lack the empathy required to build loyalty\. Our platform flips this status quo\.
