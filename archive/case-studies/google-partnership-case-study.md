# How Beings and Google Redefined UX Research: A $28M Success Story

*A case study in co-intelligence: How our partnership with Google's UX Infrastructure team transformed enterprise research and saved millions*

## The Challenge: When $100M in Research Labs Became 88% Underutilized

Google had invested over $100 million across seven years building world-class UX research labs. These state-of-the-art facilities were designed to be the gold standard for user research.

Then COVID-19 changed everything.

Post-pandemic usage dropped to just 11.8%. The fixed locations that once seemed strategic now created participant silos and limited diversity. Researchers were resorting to non-compliant tools, creating security risks with valuable user data.

**The real problem wasn't the pandemic‚Äîit was that the research world had evolved beyond physical constraints.**

Google's UX Infrastructure team, led by Andrew Ferris (Senior Programme Manager), faced a critical decision: double down on expensive physical infrastructure or pioneer a new approach to enterprise research.

## The Partnership: Co-Intelligence in Action

Rather than simply replacing one tool with another, Beings and Google's team embarked on a true co-creation journey. Through iterative discussions and analysis, we developed what became **Studio UX**‚Äîa cloud-based research platform built specifically for enterprise needs.

This wasn't about "AI-powered research." It was about creating a **co-intelligence platform** where Google's researchers could maintain full control while dramatically expanding their capabilities.

### What Made Studio UX Different

**üåç Global Accessibility**
- Browser-based platform enabling research anywhere in the world
- Seamless connectivity for participants and stakeholders
- No geographic limitations on participant diversity

**üì± Real-World Context**
- Mobile app for field studies in natural environments
- Capture authentic user behavior outside lab settings
- Multi-environment research capabilities

**ü§ù Instant Collaboration**
- Real-time collaboration eliminating research delays
- Customizable video layouts for different study scenarios
- Integrated stakeholder observation without interference

**üîí Enterprise-Grade Security**
- Stringent compliance requirements for PII handling
- Seamless integration with Google's existing infrastructure
- Unified tool ecosystem reducing security risks

## The Results: Recognition as "The Future of Research"

The impact was immediate and transformative:

### Financial Impact
- **$28 million projected savings** from reduced lab infrastructure
- **13,500 sq ft reduction** in physical research space
- Eliminated energy, transportation, and logistics costs
- Freed up budget for strategic research initiatives

### Innovation Recognition
- Andrew Ferris promoted to Product Manager
- **Internal Innovation Award** for breakthrough methodology
- Platform hailed as **"the future of research"** by Google teams
- Industry recognition for research transformation

### Operational Excellence

- Flexible, agile methodology adaptable to various study needs
- Enhanced data integrity and security protocols

## The Bigger Picture: Redefining Enterprise Research

This partnership proved that **co-intelligence isn't about replacing human expertise‚Äîit's about amplifying it.**

Google's researchers didn't lose control; they gained unprecedented flexibility. They didn't sacrifice quality for efficiency; they achieved both simultaneously.

**Key Success Factors:**

1. **Partnership Over Procurement**: We co-created rather than simply delivered
2. **Enterprise-First Design**: Built for compliance, security, and scale from day one  
3. **Researcher-Centric UX**: Enhanced rather than replaced human capabilities
4. **Measurable Impact**: Clear ROI with quantifiable business outcomes

## What This Means for Your Research Team

The Google partnership demonstrates that enterprise research transformation is possible when you have:

- **The right technology partner** who understands research workflows
- **Co-intelligence approach** that enhances rather than replaces expertise  
- **Enterprise-grade infrastructure** that meets compliance requirements
- **Measurable business impact** that justifies investment

Whether you're managing a distributed research team, struggling with compliance requirements, or looking to scale research capabilities without expanding headcount, the principles that made Google's transformation successful can work for your organization.
