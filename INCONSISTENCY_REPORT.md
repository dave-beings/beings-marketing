## 1. Brand Voice & Messaging Inconsistencies

### 1.1 AI Terminology Violations
**Brand Guidelines Say**: Avoid "AI-powered" - use specific terms like "co-intelligence" and "Hybrid Fusion Engine"

**Violations Found**:
- `content/website/markdown/pages/2025-02-21-ai-for-customer-research-at-scale.md`: "An AI-powered, human-centred platform"
- `content/blog-posts/ai-in-research-driving-innovation-or-risking-ethical-pitfalls.md`: Multiple uses of "AI-powered"
- `brand/vision-mission-values.md`: "AI-powered customer insights technology partner"
- 20+ additional files using prohibited terminology

**Impact**: Dilutes differentiated positioning and reduces to generic AI messaging

### 1.2 Product Name Confusion
**Multiple Product Names Used**:
- **Aida** (AI assistant) - Brand Voice Guide standard
- **Beam** - Found in `brand/vision-mission-values.md` and website pages
- **Beings** (platform name)
- **CloudLab** - Google partnership project name

**Inconsistent Usage Examples**:
- "Aida, your research assistant" vs. brand-preferred "Aida, your research co-pilot"
- Website pages mix "Beings" and "Beam" without clear distinction
- Case studies reference different product names for same functionality

**Impact**: Market confusion about actual product offering and capabilities

### 1.3 Value Proposition Misalignment
**Brand Voice Guide Says**: Focus on "co-intelligence" and partnership language

**Inconsistencies Found**:
- `content/website/markdown/pages/2025-02-21-ai-for-customer-research-at-scale.md`: "By handling up to 80% of the administrative workload" (automation focus)
- `content/blog-posts/ai-in-research-driving-innovation-or-risking-ethical-pitfalls.md`: "Automate up to 80% of the research workflow" (violates "don't focus only on automation" guideline)
- Multiple files emphasize replacement rather than partnership messaging

**Impact**: Contradicts core brand positioning and increases adoption resistance

## 2. Messaging Framework Inconsistencies

### 2.1 Company Description Evolution
**Old Version** (found in multiple files):

**New Version** (Brand Voice Guide):
"The co-intelligence platform for qualitative research"

**Files Still Using Old Version**:
- Multiple files in `research/` directory
- Legacy website pages
- Customer-facing materials mixed with outdated messaging

**Impact**: Confused market positioning and mixed customer expectations

### 2.2 Five Pillars Naming Confusion
**Brand Voice Guide**: Uses "Five S's" (Deeper Insights, Scalable Knowledge, Unrivaled Speed, Enterprise-Grade Trust, Joy of Research)

**Other Documents**: Still reference old pillars (Strengthen, Scale, Speed, Safety, Satisfaction)

**Found In**: 
- `brand/Content_Pillars.md` mixes both systems

**Impact**: Internal confusion and inconsistent customer messaging

**Messaging Framework v2**: Positions against "Remesh and Discuss.io"

**Other Content**: References different competitors or none at all
