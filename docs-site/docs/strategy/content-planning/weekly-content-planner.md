**Content**: "Empathy Meets Technology: The Heart Behind Beings

Beings wasn't just born out of an idea—it emerged from a deep frustration. Our founder, Dave Johnstone, spent years in tech and global events (including collaborations with Google), and he saw firsthand how researchers often found themselves bogged down by time-consuming tasks—spreadsheets, manual data crunching, and everything in between.

But here's the thing: in all that busywork, the true essence of research—understanding people—was getting lost.

Dave recognised that something needed to change."
