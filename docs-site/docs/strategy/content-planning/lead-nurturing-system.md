## Welcome Email Sequence

### **Email 1: Immediate Delivery + Welcome** (Sent immediately)

**Subject**: "Your [Lead Magnet Name] is ready + what's next"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for downloading the [Lead Magnet Name]. You can access it here: [Download Link]

I'm Dave, founder of Beings. I started this company after watching brilliant researchers spend 80% of their time on transcription, coding, and admin work instead of the strategic thinking that actually drives business value.

Over the next few weeks, I'll share insights from our work with agencies like yours - including how one 15-person agency increased capacity 40% without hiring anyone new.

Quick question: What's the biggest operational challenge your agency faces right now? Hit reply and let me know - I read every response.

Best,
Dave

P.S. If you're curious about our co-intelligence platform, here's a 2-minute demo: [Demo Link]

### **Email 2: Value Demonstration** (Day 3)

**Subject**: "How [Company] saved 15 hours per project (real example)"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Yesterday, I was talking to Ben from Quadrangle about their peak season workload.

His challenge: 35+ consultation syntheses needed during their busiest period. Normally requires multiple team members.

His solution: Used our ADA platform to handle the operational synthesis while he focused on strategy.

His result: Solo delivery of all 35 projects. Client feedback was "really well structured, clear, and commercially focused."

His words: "It was probably the most strategic presentation I've done for quite some time."

The key insight? AI doesn't replace strategic thinking - it creates space for it.

What would your agency do with 15 extra hours per project?

Best,
Dave

P.S. Ben's full case study is here if you want the details: [Case Study Link]

### **Email 3: Industry Insight** (Day 7)

**Subject**: "43% of agencies have no AI plan (opportunity or threat?)"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

A recent study caught my attention: 43% of UK firms have no AI plans at all.

For research agencies, this creates two possibilities:

**Opportunity**: Be among the early adopters who gain competitive advantage while others wait.

**Threat**: Watch competitors automate their workflows and win business with faster, more efficient delivery.

I've seen both scenarios play out. The agencies embracing AI aren't just faster - they're more profitable. They automate the grunt work so researchers can focus on what clients actually pay for: strategic insights.

The question isn't whether AI will transform research. It's whether your agency will lead that transformation or react to it.

What's your agency's position on AI adoption?

Best,
Dave

P.S. If you're ready to explore what AI could mean for your agency, here's our "AI Readiness Assessment": [Assessment Link]

### **Email 4: Customer Success Story** (Day 10)

**Subject**: "From 11.8% to 100% utilization (how AI saved $28M)"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Here's a story about waste, efficiency, and transformation:

A global tech company had invested $100M in research labs. Post-COVID usage: 11.8%.

That's $88M worth of underutilized infrastructure.

Working with our team, they built CloudLab - a co-intelligence platform that let researchers work anywhere, with anyone, on any project.

Results:
• $28M projected savings
• 13,500 sq ft of space reclaimed
• Project lead promoted + innovation award
• "Future of research" recognition

The lesson? The biggest waste isn't money spent on technology. It's human talent trapped by inefficient processes.

Your researchers are brilliant. Are your processes holding them back?

Best,
Dave

P.S. The full CloudLab case study shows exactly how they did it: [Case Study Link]

### **Email 5: Educational Content** (Day 14)

**Subject**: "The 'sparring partner' approach to AI (customer insight)"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

"AI is most helpful as a sparring partner and second opinion, but not yet reliable enough for full reliance."

That's from Iga Pilewska at Gartner, and it perfectly captures how successful researchers think about AI.

Not as replacement. As partnership.

The agencies winning with AI aren't handing over control. They're using it to:
• Generate first drafts (junior researcher role)
• Structure unorganized feedback
• Extract insights from transcripts
• Handle repetitive analysis tasks

This frees them up for what humans do best: strategic thinking, client relationships, and creative problem-solving.

The goal isn't to eliminate the researcher. It's to eliminate the parts of research that researchers don't enjoy.

How could your team benefit from an AI sparring partner?

Best,
Dave

### **Email 6: Trial Invitation** (Day 18)

**Subject**: "Ready to try ADA yourself? (Free 14-day trial)"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

### **Email 7: Social Proof & Community** (Day 25)

**Subject**: "What 19 researchers told us about AI (surprising insights)"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

We've interviewed 19+ researchers about AI adoption over the past year.

The most surprising insight? It's not about the technology.

The biggest barrier isn't cost, complexity, or even trust. It's fear of losing research skills.

One researcher put it perfectly: "I worry about becoming lazy or losing my ability to develop my own skills."

This is why we built ADA as a co-intelligence platform, not an automation tool.

Instead of replacing skills, it enhances them. Instead of making researchers lazy, it gives them space to be more strategic.

The agencies succeeding with AI aren't using it to think less. They're using it to think better.

Want to join the conversation? Our LinkedIn community discusses these topics weekly: [Community Link]

Best,
Dave

P.S. All 19 interviews confirmed the same thing: researchers want to focus on insights, not admin. That's exactly what ADA enables.
```

### **Email 8: Final Trial Push** (Day 32)

**Subject**: "The choice every research agency faces"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Every research agency faces the same choice:

**Option 1**: Keep doing things the way they've always been done. Manual transcription, manual coding, manual analysis. Compete on price and availability.

**Option 2**: Embrace co-intelligence. Automate the operational work, elevate the strategic work. Compete on insight quality and speed.

The agencies choosing Option 2 aren't just more efficient. They're more profitable, more strategic, and more valuable to their clients.

Ben from Quadrangle delivered 35+ projects solo during peak season. His client feedback: "Really well structured, clear, commercially focused."

Iga from Gartner wants "a contextualized AI assistant tailored to specific research projects."

The Google team saved $28M and called it "the future of research."

The pattern is clear: AI isn't replacing researchers. It's elevating them.

Ready to experience elevation for yourself?

No meetings, no demos, no sales calls. Just you, your data, and ADA.

Questions? Hit reply - I'm here to help you succeed.

Best,
Dave
