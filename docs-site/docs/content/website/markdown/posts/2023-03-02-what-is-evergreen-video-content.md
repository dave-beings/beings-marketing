## What is Evergreen Video Content?

https://youtu.be/-iDEfBrir5E

Evergreen video content is a powerful tool for Marketers and Content Creators looking to generate consistent views over time. This content remains relevant and useful for years, providing value to viewers and driving traffic to your channel or website. It is the opposite of "news" or "trending" content, which may lose its relevance and value quickly. 

Evergreen content is often considered "timeless." It can continue attracting visitors to your website for months or even years after publication. Evergreen video content remains relevant and valuable over a long period. 

Trendy content, on the other hand, is content based on current events or popular trends. Trendy video content capitalises on a particular moment in time or rides the wave of a viral trend. Examples of trendy content include news stories, celebrity gossip, and seasonal content.

Evergreen video content is a video you create once that continues to generate views for your business, 24/7, while you sleep. They are highly searchable, stay relevant for years, solve an apparent problem for your customer, and are free after you make the video. However, the results are not immediate, and it takes time for evergreen videos to work.

Examples of evergreen content include "how-to" guides, "top 10" lists, product reviews, and tutorials. These types of content can provide long-lasting value to your audience and help to establish your brand as a thought leader in your industry.

When creating evergreen content, it's essential to focus on timeless and relevant topics for your audience. Think about the questions your audience is asking and the problems they are trying to solve. Creating content that addresses these needs can establish your brand as a valuable resource and drive traffic to your website over the long term.

To make evergreen videos, you must consider what your customers are searching for. The videos are usually a how-to video tutorial, review or product comparison video, list video, or FAQ video answering common questions. You want to think about what your customer is searching for and create videos that catch their attention in their buying journey's awareness and research phase.

To maximise the effectiveness of your evergreen videos, there are a few things you can do. 

1. Write a blog post to go along with it. Your evergreen video content will rank higher in search results on YouTube. The blog post you write alongside it will rank highly in Google search results, driving even more views to your video. 
2. The title and thumbnail are crucial to accurately describe what the video is about while creating a bit of intrigue to get the viewer to click on them. 
3. Try getting as many views as possible in the first 48 hours of posting it. Finally, wait. Think of an evergreen video as a long-term investment where you're continually making these videos that you know will eventually pay off.

## Why is Evergreen Content Important for Your Website?

### Improves SEO

Evergreen content can help improve your website's search engine ranking, leading to more organic traffic and higher visibility in search results. Evergreen content is more likely to be shared and linked to by other websites, which can improve your website's authority and search engine ranking.

### Builds Brand Authority

Creating evergreen content that provides valuable information to your audience can establish your brand as a thought leader in your industry. This can build trust with your audience and lead to more conversions and repeat business.

### Provides Long-Term Value

Unlike news or trending content, which may lose its relevance quickly, evergreen content can continue to attract visitors to your website long after it is published. This provides long-term value to your website and helps to increase your overall traffic and engagement.

### Cost-Effective

Compared to other forms of advertising, such as paid search results or social media advertising, evergreen content is a relatively inexpensive way to attract visitors to your website and build brand awareness.

### Increases Social Shares

Evergreen content is more likely to be shared on social media platforms, which can help to increase your brand's reach and visibility. Since evergreen content remains relevant for a long time, it will likely be shared and re-shared by your audience.

## Here are some Evergreen Content Ideas

In the world of content creation, evergreen content is the holy grail. It is content that remains relevant and valuable to readers for years, even decades after publication. 

### How-to Guides and Tutorials

People will always need help with basic tasks and skills like cooking, gardening, or using software. Creating a how-to guide or tutorial can provide value to your readers. To make sure your How-to guide remains relevant, make sure to update it regularly as needed.

### Best Practices and Tips

Sharing best practices and tips is another great way to create evergreen content. People will always look for ways to improve their lives. Providing helpful information can be an excellent resource. Run a business blog. You could write articles about the best ways to increase sales or improve customer service.

### Historical Overviews

People love learning about history, and providing an overview of a specific time in history or event can make for excellent evergreen content. However, historical content doesn't have to be limited to traditional history topics. You could write an overview of the history of a specific industry or technology.

### Product Reviews and Comparisons

When people shop for a new product, they often turn to online reviews to help them decide. Writing product reviews and comparisons can be an excellent way to create evergreen content that provides value to your readers over time. For example, if you run a tech blog, you could write a comparison of the best laptops on the market.

### Listicles

While not all listicles are evergreen, some can be. Creating a list of the best books to read or hiking trails to explore can provide value to readers for years to come. Just update your list as needed to keep it fresh and relevant.

### FAQs and Glossaries

Creating a FAQ or glossary can be an excellent way to provide value to your readers. FAQs can answer common questions about your industry or product, while glossaries can define key terms and concepts. Both can provide value to readers for years to come.
