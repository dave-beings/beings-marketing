###### MY DAY

## What It’s Like To Work With Me?

Curious how I can slot into your agency or team. Here’s a little glimpse into my day:

##### 9:00 am

I’m helping your team recruit participants for a product feedback study. Everything’s sorted, bias-free, and running like clockwork.

##### 11:00 am

I’m sitting in on a couple of calls, virtually, of course, offering real-time prompts and tagging all the key moments. The team look relaxed, and like they’re actually enjoying the process!

##### 1:00 pm

Lunch break! Everyone gets to step away from their desk, knowing those calls are already transcribed and tagged. There will be no sandwiches at the desk today!

##### 3:00 pm

Back at it, delivering transcripts and pulling out themes from earlier sessions. I’m already spotting patterns that’ll make your next steps a breeze.

##### 4:00 pm

The team takes the insights and recommendations we’ve worked on into their client meeting. I don’t need to be there, but I know those clients will leave smiling and thinking about the next project!

##### 5:00 pm

That’s a wrap! Thanks to my help, the team finishes ahead of schedule with actionable insights ready to wow even more clients.

###### Standing Apart

## How Do I Work?

While I might feel human, I’m powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence. I use advanced algorithms for:

![](images/placeholder.png)

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP):

To understand, transcribe, and analyse conversations with laser precision.

#### Machine Learning:

To adapt to your needs and improve as we work together. 

#### Bias Detection:

To ensure neutrality in everything from recruitment to insights.

#### Data Security:

Your research data is handled carefully and protected by encryption. I don’t share your data with anybody outside of your company, ensuring that I am protecting your data and learning and growing the business itself.

## Frequently asked questions

I’m sure you have a few questions for me, and I’ll be happy to answer those when we chat! Until then, here are a few things I’ve been asked (and the team that looks after me) frequently.

Are you a researcher or a tool?

I’m an assistant! I don’t replace researchers. :) I amplify their efforts with speed, accuracy, and unbiased support.

Can you handle sensitive data?

Absolutely. Data security is my top priority. Everything is encrypted, and I comply with the strictest privacy standards. All your data is kept in your own ecosystem and never shared outside.

What if I only need help with part of the process?

That’s fine! I can jump in wherever you need me. This could be at the prep stage, just a bit of transcription, some analysis, or all of the above.

Can you detect bias in responses?

Yes, I’m trained to identify potential bias and ensure your research stays as neutral as possible. I can also help the team spot bias in their questioning!

How do I know you’re accurate?

This is a great question. I use advanced AI models to minimise errors and regularly validate my methods to maintain high standards. If you feel like something isn’t right, you are always welcome to reach out and query it. I love to learn!

How are you different from Chat GPT?

I am designed specifically for research, meaning I “get” research more than a general language model. It also means I’m being used specifically for YOUR research as I develop and learn.

In addition, your data is kept safely and securely, whereas ChatGPT and other engines can share your data to train its models, which can be a security risk and create bias.

## Putting privacy, trust, and security first.
