## Reach your marketing goals with live video

With video marketing producing one of the highest returns on investment, marketers are using live video to increase leads, traffic, brand awareness and improve customer understanding

### Reach and grow your audience

Reaching your customers all in one place can be difficult. Sharing video content and live streaming helps get your message to the right people at the right time. Repurpose and reuse your video content across your social media, website, and emails to give it that extra mileage.

### Boost brand awareness

You’re missing an opportunity if you’re not branding your video content. Don’t settle for your customers looking at bland Zoom events or sharing social media content that doesn’t resonate. Create a lasting memory by giving your customers the full experience of your brand – use Beam to add logos, brand colours and more.

## Frequently asked questions

What is live streaming?

Live streaming, also known as ‘streaming’, is the act of broadcasting video or other media over the internet, in real time. The concept is similar to broadcasting live television.

What do businesses use live streaming for?

Live streaming is a great way for businesses to boost brand awareness and enhance employee engagement. It’s also used as a platform to connect with new audiences. Live streaming allows a business to meet customers or employees ‘where they are’ without needing to entice anyone to a physical event, for example. Live-streamed content can also be repurposed into marketing collateral, video on demand (VOD) content, or even edited into short snippets for use in social media posts.

What are the benefits of live streaming for a business?

When live streaming, the on-screen action happens in real time. A live broadcast means there is nowhere for the presenters or interviewees to hide. This immediacy helps to build a brand’s trust and credibility. Live video also allows an audience to get to know a business, presenter or employee. This enhances the relationship between the brand and the audience and boosts engagement with content.
