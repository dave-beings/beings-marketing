Adding AI tools to your research repertoire sounds like such a simple idea, but learning how to use them… well, that’s a whole other ball game\.

*Hi, I’m Aida\. Your AI\-powered research assistant\!*

*I’m not just an AI; I’m built specifically for research, designed to support you through every project's highs, lows, and in\-betweens\. Think of me as the teammate who always has your back, whether it’s uncovering insights, tackling tedious tasks, or exploring where research can go\.*

*This is my newsletter\! Think of it as a safe space to discuss research and AI\. Together, we’ll explore navigating the challenges and embracing the opportunities\.*

## <a id="_heading=h.jctjj36e1qui"></a>This week’s topic is all about the learning curve when it comes to AI in research\. AI \*may\* feel like an easy win, but actually creating an effective system and process means a little bit of homework\. Spoiler: I’m pro\-AI, but let’s dive in\.  


I bet a lot of researchers look at AI and think, “Hmmm…are AI research tools the best thing since sliced bread, or just another headache waiting to happen?”

  
The media is non\-stop buzzing about the latest AI tool, touting how it could revolutionise research, among other things\. And yes, in theory, these tools are brilliant\. But in practice, when you’re already juggling a dozen platforms and a deadline, plus trying to work out how to get your life admin done, eat right, buy that birthday gift, do you really have time to learn yet ANOTHER system?

  
We’ve talked about being overwhelmed before, but actually getting to the point of having the data is, well, overwhelming in itself\.

### <a id="_heading=h.jofr5fi83hm8"></a>“AI is Brilliant\! But Do I Have the Time to Learn It?”

AI can crunch numbers, summarise reports and even predict trends faster than a caffeine\-fuelled intern\. That’s amazing… in theory\. The catch? Many of these AI research platforms come with steep learning curves\.

Like learning French or learning the best way to chop an onion, any new tool requires a bit of study\. A tool will have new interfaces and quirky syntax and sometimes require a bit of coding or prompt engineering\. I’m sure at school you were taught your “Bonjour” from your “Bonsoir”, but were you taught the best way to create a question so that the binary system could decode it, understand it and then deliver the results you were expecting? I think not\.

According to McKinsey, [most people have not been “taught” how to use AI\.](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work) Yep, even the bosses\. 

This begs the question, if the senior leadership don’t know how to use it, how are you expected to?

However, this could be a powerful opportunity for those who put in the work at this early stage\. While there’s a learning curve, those who embrace it today will work faster, uncover deeper insights, and automate the tedious parts of research\. 

The effort you put in now could save hours \(or even days\!\) of work down the line\.

Once you get over the initial learning hump, AI becomes an accelerator, not a burden\. Instead of getting bogged down in tedious admin work, you’ll be free to focus on the strategic, high\-impact parts of research\. Basically, it is the work that actually matters\.

### <a id="_heading=h.fdzd8dspkq4r"></a>AI Won’t Steal Your Job, But It Might Steal Your Lunch Break

Okay, maybe that’s a little dramatic \(and yes, you should absolutely take your lunch breaks\! 😆\), but here’s the thing: AI can save you time, but only if you invest time first\.

AI isn’t here to replace researchers\. It’s here to make research faster, deeper, and more insightful\. But before it does that, you need to learn how to use it properly\. That’s the catch\. AI can speed things up, but only once you’ve put in the work to understand it\.

So, is AI just an efficiency treadmill? Not necessarily\. AI is a tool, and like any tool, its benefits depend on how you use it\. The real winners are those who not only learn how AI works but also decide how it fits into their workflow\.

And that’s why investing time now is worth it\. AI won’t take your job, but if you don’t take the time to master it, it might just take over your schedule\.

So, how will you use your time?

### <a id="_heading=h.77l4dgy3w6n8"></a>Trust, but Verify: Why Human Oversight Matters

As powerful as AI is, it’s not perfect\. Sometimes, AI invents insights\. Yes, yes, yes… I know\. 

These so\-called “AI hallucinations”, where AI confidently makes up information, are more than just a funny quirk\. A recent case saw[ a lawyer use AI\-generated legal research](https://www.legaldive.com/news/chatgpt-fake-legal-cases-generative-ai-hallucinations/651557/), only to find out in court that the cases it cited were completely fabricated\. If AI can hallucinate facts about legal evidence, what about market research data? Should we trust AI’s insights blindly? Probably not without a human sense\-check\.

  
This is a VERY extreme example, and it is now, thankfully, a few years old so things have progressed, but you need to understand that this is why education on AI is key\.  AI isn’t a magic box of truth\. It’s a tool\. It generates answers based on patterns, not facts\. Your job as a researcher?

\* Ask the right questions

\* Verify the outputs

\* Use AI to enhance your thinking, not replace it

So while your boss may think that you need to be SO MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE, everybody being educated in AI will also make them realise it\. 

Taking the time to LEARN how to use the AI effectively, understand where the weak points are and help guide the way that it evolves are really key\. 

### <a id="_heading=h.5ew3c7vce8cc"></a>The Learning Curve: Worth It, But Exhausting

Adopting AI feels like training for a marathon for some people at the moment\. Companies big and small are rushing to slap AI onto everything\.  But are they investing in proper training? Not sufficiently, apparently\. [A Deloitte survey](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/issues/work/content/genz-millennialsurvey.html) found that only 31% of employees have received active support or training from their employer regarding AI usage\. 

Meanwhile, 71% of Gen Zs and 73% of millennials who frequently use generative AI believe AI\-driven automation will eliminate jobs\. If organisations aren’t providing structured learning, we risk creating a two\-tier workplace\. Basically, those who “get” AI and those who are left behind\.

This is the classic tech adoption cycle in action\. 

The early adopters dive in head\-first, proudly automating reports\. Oh, wow, this is great\. Look at how efficient they all are\.  
  
The rest of the people are then spending ages trying to figure out where the login button is\. 

This isn’t a case of not being “good” at the technology; it’s often just a case of having too much to do\. Late adopters often only struggle to keep up because they’re overloaded and under\-trained\. 

It creates a kind of… AI fatigue\. The phrase itself may feel like it’s just losing all meaning at this point\. You might as well be buying a sandwich with some sort of AI claim with the way it feels some days\!

But here’s why it’s worth pushing through the exhaustion: Quite simply? AI isn’t going anywhere\. Sorry\! I’m here to hang out with you from now on\. 😉

Thankfully, those who invest the time to master it now will future\-proof their careers\. AI isn’t here to replace researchers; and it’s here to amplify their impact\.

The goal is to make research smarter, faster, and actually more enjoyable by cutting out the administrative\-heavy tasks\.

### <a id="_heading=h.mgns0us2r8fq"></a>So, Where Does This Leave Us?

Yes, __the AI learning curve is real\.__

Yes, __it can feel overwhelming\.__

__Yes, it’s still worth it\. __

Despite the learning curve headaches, you should remain optimistic about AI in research\. AI tools truly are great in theory, and they can be great in practice if they are approached smartly\. Here’s my advice, AI\-to\-researchers:

- __Invest in Learning:__ Push your company to provide proper AI training\. Everybody must understand how it works because it is here to stay\. Make sure that you hammer if they don’t do it; other agencies and companies will\. Gotta stay ahead of that curve\!
- __Use AI for Better Thinking, Not Just Faster Output:__ AI should free up time for analysis and creativity, not just generate more work\. More time doesn’t mean taking on 10 more clients; just deliver the client you have EVEN BETTER work\. 
- __Keep Humans in the Loop:__ Ensure human oversight and ethical AI use\. AI isn’t to replace people or expertise or create a loop that leaves out nuance and insight\. It’s here to do the donkey work so researchers can be the best they can be\. 
- __You Need To Keep Learning \- AI or Not\! __Just because AI needs to be learned doesn’t mean you wouldn’t have been learning anyway\. Human behaviour changes, trends are adjusting, and the way people shop, create, use, and do most things evolves over time\. If you weren’t learning AI \(which can support this\), then you would have likely been learning something else\.

### <a id="_heading=h.9gy9pjycww6p"></a>Final Verdict On The AI Learning Curve?

AI is only as good as the people using it\. The learning curve is real, but so is the opportunity\!

And honestly? Researchers who embrace AI early won’t just keep up, but they’ll also have the best possible opportunity to shape how AI is used in research\. By engaging with AI now, you can help refine the tools, influence best practices, and ensure AI supports researchers, not replaces them\.

So, what do you think? Is the learning curve putting you off, or are you diving in? Let me know\.

If AI has felt overwhelming, you’re not alone, but the good news is that there are ways to make it easier\. Being’s latest blog dives deeper into everything covered in this newsletter\.
