Meta Description: When the numbers look fine but something feels off, qual shows you why\. Here's how AI can support deep insight without flattening the meaning\.

<a id="_zaazj7m208fz"></a>Quant Is "Sexy"\. But Qual Is Where Your Edge Is\.

*Why more data doesn’t necessarily give you what you need \(even if it looks good\)*

There’s a moment that keeps happening\. Maybe it’s familiar? You’re in a playback, or a pitch rehearsal with too many slides and not enough time\. And someone flashes up a stat, a really chunky one\. Maybe it’s got a percentage\. Maybe it’s backed by 2,000 people\. Perhaps it has been tested and retested, and now it sits at the centre of the story, like a stone in a ring\.

And it does its job\. It draws attention\. Nods go round the room\. Someone rewrites their next slide on the spot\. You can feel the energy shift\.

That’s what a good stat does\. It feels clean, confident and like truth\.

But then you blink\. And the moment passes\. And if you’re like me, you start to wonder…what does it actually *mean*?

__What Do You Need to Know__

__The problem?  
__ AI tools are turning up in every part of the research process\. That sounds useful\. But most are designed for speed, not depth\. They simplify when they should pause\. They treat language like data, sorted and summarised before anyone has really sat with what was said\.

__Why it matters?  
__ When nuance is lost, insight gets shallow\. You end up with answers that sound neat but don’t explain much\. Some of the most important signals are subtle\. They sit in the tension, in the contradictions, in the parts that don't immediately make sense\. If you skip past those, you miss what actually shifts thinking\.

__Where it breaks?__

-  AI summaries can sound polished but lack substance\.
-  Contradictions get ironed out too early\.
-  Responses are grouped before the meaning is clear\.
-  Verbatims are used to decorate findings, not develop them\.
-  Researchers trust outputs without reading what fed them\.
-  The difficult, interesting parts are left behind\.

__What could help?  
__

-  Choose AI that respects the complexity of language\.
-  Keep people at the centre of the analysis\.
-  Make room to sit with the data before sorting it\.
-  Use the uncomfortable bits as a starting point, not a flaw\.
-  Focus on what people meant, not just what they said\.

### <a id="_ofqvh7go0af9"></a>__Numbers are good at showing shape\. But not meaning\.__

Quant tells you what happened in the clearest possible factoid\. It shows you patterns, peaks, dips, slices, segments\. It’s great for surfacing problems and tracking signals and catching things early before they become expensive or political\. It helps people move forward with decisions that would otherwise feel risky\.

However, as much as we put all our energies into “proof”, to some degree, that’s all quant can really do\. 

Where it often lacks is it doesn’t give you the context or the why\. It doesn’t show you what people meant when they clicked that option\. It doesn’t ask why someone hesitated\. Or what they *wanted* to see in that moment instead\.

And I know we try to plug those gaps\. We tag things\. We segment\. We build mixed methods studies\. We add verbatims\. But you can’t verbatim your way out of not knowing the person behind the answer\.

As seasoned research professional Graham Hall said to me recently, when we were talking about this exact thing: *“It’s all just counting tweets\. But what are they saying?”*

Ouch\. 

### <a id="_zfzgsub9tdi5"></a>__This is not a takedown of quant__

Let’s be clear: I like numbers\. I use them\. I trust them to do a specific job\. It sets the stage and proves a point; it backs things up like a skeleton\. This isn’t about me pretending qual is more noble or more meaningful or inherently more human\.

It’s just a reminder \(for me, for anyone who needs it\!\) that quant only gets you halfway\. And that halfway is not enough when you’re dealing with messy questions\. Human questions\. Strategy questions\. Things that don’t sit neatly in a table or bar chart\.

This looks like:  


-  *Why isn’t this brand landing with this group anymore?  
*
-  *What’s making people hesitate?  
*
-  *Why do the numbers look fine, but the energy feels wrong?*

Because that’s the gap where things get interesting, that’s where the work happens\.

### <a id="_ibo2j7xnuy1"></a>__Qual is slower, more awkward, and better at holding tension__

Insight work often gets treated as something linear\. You start with raw data and move quickly towards a packaged output\. A slide that can be shared and discussed\. The pressure to move fast is constant, especially when time is short or stakeholders expect certainty\.

That pace encourages simplification\. Things that don’t fit the framework are edited out\. Quotes that complicate the narrative are ignored\. Contradictions get written off as noise\. These decisions aren’t malicious\. They’re practical\. They help move the work forward\. But they also flatten it\.

This is where qualitative work forces a different approach\. It draws attention to the parts that don’t fit\. It slows things down, not out of principle, but because meaning takes time to see clearly\. When someone says one thing but means another, or when their language resists easy grouping, it signals something important\. Not dramatic or emotional\. Just important\.

Those moments often contain the insight\. They reveal the gap between what people say and what they believe\. They highlight where behaviours don’t align with the narrative being built around them\. When these things are handled with care, they shift the direction of the work\. Not in a grand or obvious way\. Just enough to improve it\.

Qualitative analysis allows for this shift\. It does not promise a single answer\. It makes space for uncertainty, contradiction and change\. It can be frustrating to work with, especially when deadlines are close and decisions need to be made\. But the value is found in that discomfort\. 

You are not looking for something dramatic\. You are looking for something accurate\. Something that reflects the messiness of human thought and behaviour without forcing it into a neater shape than it needs\. This is where good qualitative work sits\. 

### <a id="_ysusi3yles9v"></a>__This is where your edge is__

Quant gives structure\. It illustrates the shape of a problem and allows people to move quickly\. But when the numbers look fine and something still doesn’t feel right, you need more than structure\. You need context\. You need texture and to hear what people are actually saying, not just what they clicked\.

AI can support that work, but only if it’s built with qualitative thinking in mind\. Most tools still treat language like data\. They group and summarise quickly, but often miss the point\. If the goal is speed alone, you lose the insight that comes from sitting with what doesn’t fit\.

Some tools are getting closer\. In 2025, the[ UK government piloted a system called *Humphrey*](https://www.techradar.com/pro/humphrey-to-the-rescue-uk-gov-seeks-to-save-millions-by-using-ai-tool-to-analyse-input-on-thousands-of-consultations) to help analyse responses to public consultations\. In one trial, the AI reviewed over 2,000 written responses and matched human analysts on key themes\. It cut the analysis time significantly, and officials say it could save £20 million a year by reducing manual review for government projects\. For researchers working with scale, that’s useful\. But even in that context, people flagged the limits, theme coding is still subjective, and the AI’s usefulness depended on how it was trained and what it was trained on\.

This is exactly why Beings exist\. It’s made for researchers who want AI that actually understands how qualitative insight works\. It holds onto the language, the complexity, and the logic behind what people say\. It helps you work faster without flattening the meaning\. It can handle scale, but still respects the gaps and tensions that make qual useful in the first place\.

If you want a bit more insight, or just some practical examples of what this actually looks like in action, have a read of our blog on __how AI can support deep qual, not just shiny dashboards__\. We break down where most tools fall short and how we’ve approached things differently with Beings\.
