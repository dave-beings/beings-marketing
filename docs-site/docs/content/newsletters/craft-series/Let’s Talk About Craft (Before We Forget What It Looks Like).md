Meta Description:__ Have we made things too easy? A critical look at how convenience is eroding skill, judgment, and the craft we once took pride in\.__

<a id="_eucp6lo6lc7s"></a>Let’s Talk About Craft \(Before We Forget What It Looks Like\)

Humans are astonishing in their ability to solve hard problems… especially when those problems get in the way of comfort\.

We invent systems to reduce friction\. We build tools that cut steps out of tedious processes\. We reward the people who find elegant shortcuts\. \(Bill Gates once said he’d hire a lazy person to do a hard job, because they’d figure out the fastest way to do it\.\)

And that instinct, to ease the burden, to make life simpler, it *works*\. Until it doesn’t…

Somewhere along the way, the shortcuts often stopped being clever\. They became expected\. Then invisible\. And now, for a lot of things that used to require actual skill or judgment or care, the default is: don’t think too hard, there’s a quicker way\.

We’re not just automating tasks but offloading effort\. And in the process, we’re quietly forgetting what craft ever felt like\.

This is risky, because while I’m talking about this in the sense of research, this is something that can degrade any person\. Even the master of their craft\.

## <a id="_wbpz97kkswjg"></a>What You Need to Know

__The problem  
__We’ve made things too convenient\. AI writes up notes before we’ve fully thought them through\. Workflows are streamlined to the point of autopilot\. We’ve trained ourselves to avoid friction, and in doing so, we’ve made depth feel unnecessary\. Over time, skill gives way to shortcuts\. Not because we’re lazy, but because the system encourages us not to try\.

__Why it matters  
__Craft doesn’t vanish overnight\. It fades\. You still get outputs, but the care, the judgement, the quiet decisions that made those outputs meaningful? Gone\. And if you’ve ever wondered why something feels thinner or why your work isn’t landing the way it used to—this might be why\. It also leaves newer practitioners without the chance to build depth in the first place\.

__Where it goes wrong__

- Convenience becomes the default, not the tool  

- Questions don’t get sharpened, they get summarised  

- AI gives you a “good enough” version of thinking  

- Research still *looks* right, but the underlying care is missing  

- Nobody’s asking how we got to the insight—they’re too busy moving on  


__What helps__

- Notice where you’re coasting\. Pause before you hit autopilot  

- Use tools to support structure, not replace thought  

- Protect the parts of your process that still demand effort  

- Let friction sharpen your judgement—not feel like failure  

- Stay awake to the decisions you’re making \(or not making\)

## <a id="_vzzzvij41flp"></a>__We optimised for ease, but lost our appetite for depth__

The promise of technology, of systems, of tools, of clever workflows, has always been that it frees us up to focus on what matters\. In fact, I have spoken at length about the amazing things that we can do now that our brain and time is free\. 

And for a while, it did\. We stopped chopping wood because we had central heating\. We stopped memorising facts because we had Google\. We stopped asking questions in rooms full of people because we could ask the internet instead\. Seems better, faster, more easy, less error, the ideal… right?

But we didn’t use that extra time or space to think more deeply\. We used it to move on to the next thing\. And the next\. And the next\.

The friction disappeared, but so did the patience\. The noise increased, but the discernment didn’t\.

And so, slowly, without malice or intention, we stopped flexing the parts of ourselves that used to separate craft from content\. That used to help us *care* about how something was done, not just whether it was done at all\.

Again, this is something I’ve spoken about before in the frame of the new generation, not having those skills to call their foundation\. However, in those who have learned those things, taken the time to learn and train, it can really slip away\. That’s the concern\. You outsource it all to the point you don’t remember what you’re doing\.

## <a id="_vqiigdv1onlz"></a>__Convenience isn’t the enemy but it makes forgetting dangerously easy__

Take something as basic as making dinner\.

It used to involve decisions: What ingredients do I have? What flavours make sense? How long do I have? Now it’s: What’s fastest? What’s in a packet? What gets me to "fed" without thinking? We are using Deliveroo\. Or, TikTok\. Microwave meals\. Things designed to help have become the default\. And this is no fault of ours as humans\. 

In Daniel Liberman’s book, [*Exercised*](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/305451/exercised-by-lieberman-daniel/9780141986364)*, *he talks about how if you watch our primate cousins, they will be as lazy as possible\. This is our fundamental programming to retain energy, ready for explosive reaction as needed\. Our lives have changed, but our fundamental programming as a species has not\. 

Even look at how people read\. We skim\. We summarise\. We use tools to surface the “key points” before our brains have even had a chance to engage\. We want insights pre\-chewed and ready to swallow, and then wonder why they don’t stick\.

It’s not laziness, exactly\. It’s just that *when ease is always an option*, effort starts to feel like a mistake\. Why spend 10 minutes thinking through a problem when an AI can give you 10 bullet points in two seconds? Why ask a second question when the first one already sounds good enough?

But this kind of convenience rewires what we value\. It makes shallow fluency feel like depth\. It makes friction look like failure\.

And the longer we swim in that current, the less we notice what it’s washing away\.

## <a id="_sempcwqt9lao"></a>__Research hasn’t escaped this shift__

It’s easy to look at research and think the discipline is thriving\. There are more tools than ever, more people doing it, more stakeholder appetite\. The workflows are smoother\. The templates are faster\. The outputs are cleaner\.

But underneath all that infrastructure, something quieter is happening\.

__Craft__\. The kind of care that shapes not just *what* we learn, but also *how* we choose to learn it, is wearing thin \(because we are letting it\!\)\.

You don’t notice it right away, because nothing is obviously broken\. The insights still sound like insights\.

But if you ask people to show their working, to talk about how they chose this method or why that question mattered or what tradeoff they wrestled with, the answers are starting to get vague\.

It’s not that they don’t care\. It’s that the system doesn’t demand it anymore\. 

And when nobody slows down to ask what was skipped, the sharp edges dull without anyone noticing\.

This isn’t an argument for going back\. No one’s saying we should reject automation or rebuild everything from scratch like it’s 2003\. But we do need to remember what those tools were meant to support, not replace\.

## <a id="_ei6ll1os2nn2"></a>__Craft lives in decisions__

It’s in the moment you realise the real question isn’t the one the stakeholder asked\. Those moments don’t always show up in the final output, but they shape whether that output *matters*\.You then get something that holds up under pressure, something that doesn’t just answer a question, but changes how it’s being asked\.

And that takes effort\. Not performative effort, not perfectionism, just care\. Applied over time, in ways that compound\.

## <a id="_522rboz2juav"></a>__So where do we go from here?__

The answer isn’t to ditch the tools\. It’s to stay awake while using them\.

AI can be brilliant at speed, at giving you a clearer picture, at expanding your thinking\. But it won’t notice when you’re coasting\. That’s still on you\.

Craft only fades when we stop paying attention\. Not because we got worse, but because the system made it easy not to try\.

So notice where you're slipping into autopilot\.
