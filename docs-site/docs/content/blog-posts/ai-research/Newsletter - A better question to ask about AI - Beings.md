Discover the crucial difference between the 'poetry' an AI finds and the 'poem' a human researcher writes\.

# <a id="_67oib6azl9n0"></a>A better question to ask about AI

Here’s the thing about AI in research that nobody seems to be saying:

It’s not here to replace your thinking\.

It’s here to do something far more interesting\.

We keep asking: “Can it find the insight?”

Wrong question\.

Better question: “How does it help us create?”

Because an LLM doesn’t deliver a final insight\. It reveals poetry\.

What’s the difference?

Poetry is the raw potential in the data\. The hidden music in a dozen transcripts\. The way themes and verbatims cluster together mathematically\. It's the "what\."

An insight is what happens when a human researcher takes that poetry and shapes it with intention, empathy, and craft\. It's the "so what\."

The machine gives us the raw material\. We make the art\.

This simple idea changes everything\. It means your value isn't just in the long hours of manual analysis\. It's in your strategic interpretation\. Your ability to tell the story that resonates with a client\.

We believe this is the most important shift in research for a generation\. It’s the core of how we're building tools at Beings—not to replace researchers, but to be a quiet, capable partner for their craft\.

We wrote more about this in our blog post\.
