# <a id="_heading=h.rkauvaszmhzv"></a>__Training Junior Researchers in a World of Auto\-Generated Insight__

Junior researchers are entering the field at a time when transcripts are auto\-generated, themes are pre\-tagged, and insights can be summarised with a prompt\. The tools are fast and often accurate\. But with that ease and insight, there is a risk that entry to the field is now lower, and the learning curve has flattened\. That’s not a bad thing\. But it also means we may lose some of the nuance and depth that comes from real\-life experience of doing the work\.

That shift has sparked conversations across the industry\. In a recent post, our founder Dave shared concerns that many new researchers don’t yet know what ‘good’ looks like\. Not because they aren’t capable, but because they haven’t been shown the messy, hands\-on parts of the job\. When the tools do the grunt work, what’s left to teach? And what happens when the tools get it wrong?

What used to be learned through hours of immersion \(reading transcripts, coding by hand, sitting with ambiguity\) is now delivered in a few bullet points\. That has benefits, but it also brings a risk\. If researchers are only trained to review rather than build, the foundations of good insight may weaken over time\.

This piece explores what still needs to be taught, how training has shifted, and how AI, such as [Aida from Beings](https://app.beings.com/), can be part of the solution as a tool that keeps thinking front and centre\.

## <a id="_heading=h.fce8tef3wfdx"></a>__Training New Researchers in a World of AI At a Glance__

- Junior researchers often start with AI summaries instead of raw data\. This speeds things up but can skip key learning moments  

- Reviewing output is not the same as learning how to build it\. Foundational research skills still matter  

- AI should be part of the training process, not just a tool used at the end\. It works best as a thinking companion, not a shortcut  

- The most effective teams combine both approaches\. Manual exposure to the mess, supported by smart tools  

- Tools like Aida help researchers sharpen their judgement as they work and keep thinking at the centre  


## <a id="_heading=h.guj3q6ku3l5z"></a>__The Shift from Building to Reviewing__

In many teams, junior researchers are now starting their careers in environments where the AI handles the first pass\. Many are not being asked to code manually, or read transcripts line by line\. Instead, their job is to review, edit, refine, and package\. That sounds efficient, however, in practice it can mean that foundational skills are skipped\.

Those skills still matter\. They are where researchers develop judgement\. They are how you learn to recognise bias, to hear tone, to notice what has not been said\. They are the difference between delivering insight and just repeating output\.

## <a id="_heading=h.g36269jwjnb7"></a>__What Is Getting Lost__

Without exposure to the raw, unstructured parts of research, it becomes harder to:

- Understand how themes are built, not just labelled  

- Notice contradictions or tensions in what people say  

- Question summaries that sound good but miss the point  

- Spot overly confident conclusions based on weak data  

- Recognise when the same voices are being amplified over and over  


This is not a complaint about AI\. It is a reminder that tools change what we see\. If the only version of the data a junior researcher sees is a pre\-tagged, machine\-summarised one, then the questions they learn to ask may be too narrow\.

## <a id="_heading=h.a1a94lbbd4e8"></a>__Practical Approaches That Still Work__

Training for craft does not need to mean abandoning automation\. But it does require intention\. A few examples:

- Give juniors the AI summary and the full transcript\. Ask them what is missing\.  

- Invite them to code by hand first, then compare their results to the machine’s\.  

- Encourage slow reads before editing anything\.  

- Include sessions where teams discuss *why* a code was chosen, not just *what* it is\.  

- Teach prompt\-writing as part of the research process, not just a technical step\.  


These approaches are not about slowing everything down\. They are about keeping critical thinking in the room\. The ability to question, reflect, and challenge is still where good research comes from\. That does not get faster just because the tools have\.

## <a id="_heading=h.u1ayvbka1g0h"></a>__Using AI as a Training Partner__

Some teams are already treating AI not just as a tool, but as a teaching companion\. For example:

- Let junior researchers try different prompts and talk through the results  

- Ask them to flag hallucinations or gaps in the AI summary  

- Keep track of what changes were made to machine\-generated output, and why  

- Rotate between AI\-led and human\-led analysis so no one becomes dependent on just one view  


This helps make the invisible parts of analysis visible again\. It creates a space where newer researchers are not just checking boxes, but learning to think\.

AI can make the process faster, but learning to think well still takes time\. If junior researchers only ever see the cleaned\-up version of the data, they will not know what messy looks like\. And if they cannot see the mess, they cannot learn how to sort through it\.

Training is not just about efficiency, but depth\. And if we want the next generation of researchers to be as sharp as the tools they use, we need to keep making space for that\.

## <a id="_heading=h.2dgrk52mz9rl"></a>__How AI Built for Researchers Can Support, Not Replace__

Tools like Aida make this easier\. They are built for researchers and this means it can do more than speed things up\. It can create space for better thinking\. Sometimes that means surfacing patterns or suggesting themes\. Sometimes it means stepping back and letting the researcher do the digging while offering quiet support in the background\. It does not need to take over\. It can stay flexible, whether you want to be fully hands\-on or just get a little nudge in the right direction\.

Instead of replacing the skill, it can help shape it\. Prompt writing becomes something to practise, not something to depend on\. Edits to a summary become part of the learning, not just a tidy\-up job\. Even the smaller things, spotting gaps, noticing repeated voices, seeing how conclusions evolve, help build sharper judgement over time\.

The real value is not just in faster output\. It is in helping people learn to ask better questions, notice what is missing, and build the confidence to challenge what looks neat but does not quite hold\. That kind of thinking takes time\. But with the right support, it becomes part of the process\.

If you want your team to grow their skills while they work, not after, start using Aida\. It is free to try and built for researchers like you and any new recruits in the future\.
