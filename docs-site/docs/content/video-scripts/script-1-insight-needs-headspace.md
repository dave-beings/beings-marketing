- **Length**: 30-60 seconds
- **Style**: Direct-to-camera, conversational

## Production Guidelines

### üé• Setup Instructions
- **Camera**: Set up your shot using natural light if possible (face a window)
- **Framing**: Medium close-up (MCU), looking directly into the camera

## üó£Ô∏è Script
*(Feel free to paraphrase if it helps your flow)*

"If AI's making decisions for you, you're doing it wrong.

I get it‚Äîresearch agencies are under pressure. Tight timelines, too much data, not enough hours in the day. AI can help‚Ä¶ but only if we stay in the driver's seat.

I use AI to speed up the repetitive stuff‚Äîtranscription, clustering, summaries. It's like having a really fast junior researcher who never gets tired. But insight? That still needs a human.

We're not here to outsource our thinking. We're here to make space for it.

The best work I've seen recently? It's from teams who collaborate with AI‚Äînot hand everything over.

So yeah, let it tag quotes or group themes. But the story, the 'so what,' the nuance? That's still on us.

Insight takes headspace. AI just gives us the room to find it."

**Tagline**: If AI's making decisions without you, you're doing it wrong. Let's talk about working smarter WITHOUT handing over the reins.

**Introduction**: Hi, I'm Aida. Your AI-powered research assistant! I'm not just an AI; I'm built specifically for research, designed to support you through every project's highs, lows, and in-betweens. Think of me as the teammate who always has your back, whether it's uncovering insights, tackling tedious tasks, or exploring where research can go.

### Key Statistics
- **56% of researchers** are already using AI to support their work (2024 User Interviews report)
- **Up from 20%** in 2023
- **14 minutes per day** saved on repetitive admin (Microsoft Copilot users)
- **Nearly 5 hours per month** reclaimed for deeper thinking

### Core Message Points

#### AI Can Handle Tasks‚ÄîBut It Shouldn't Handle Judgement
- AI excels at: transcription, tagging themes, clustering comments, highlighting sentiment
- AI limitations: drawing conclusions, writing insights, understanding nuance
- **Analogy**: Think of AI as your junior researcher‚Äîbrilliant with detail, fast with structure, but still learning nuance

#### The Best Work Happens When AI & Humans Collaborate
- Not a binary choice between automation vs. manual work
- Most exciting insight work comes from teams using AI as assistant, not replacement
- AI handles "admin-heavy, time-consuming gumph"
- Humans provide experience, nuance, and social knowledge to read between the lines

### Practical Applications
AI can be used for:
- Analyzing volume and spotting patterns
- Structuring reports
- Processing large datasets
- Identifying themes and sentiment

Humans remain essential for:
- Final narrative development
- Strategic interpretation
- Contextual understanding
- Client communication
