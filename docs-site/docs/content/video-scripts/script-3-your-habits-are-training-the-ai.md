"AI doesn't just learn from your best work. It learns from all of it‚Äîyour habits, your shortcuts, even your compromises under pressure.

If you reuse last week's deck without thinking? If you let a 'good enough' summary slide through? AI notices. And it starts to think: 'Ah. That's how we do research here.'

That's the risk‚Äîand the opportunity.

Because AI isn't judging. It's copying. It doesn't know if a theme was chosen with care‚Ä¶ or because the clock was ticking.

So we have to be deliberate. If we're not careful, we end up teaching it to scale our sloppiest moments.

That's not about slowing down. It's about showing the system what 'good' actually looks like‚Äîconsistently.

Because every approve, every edit, every "yep, that'll do"‚Äîis training data.

So the next time something feels a little too polished, a little too familiar, pause. Ask: Did I shape this? Or did the tool just learn what I let slide?"

### Reference Article: "AI Is Learning from Us, And That Might Be a Problem"

**Standfirst**: AI tools are learning from our habits, decisions, and compromises, not just our best work. What we teach them now will shape the future of research.

### Core Message
AI is getting better at research not because it understands people, but because it has been trained on us. It learns how we write, segment, code, build hypotheses, summarize, and interpret‚Äîwithout distinguishing between best practice and habit.

### Key Concepts

#### The Learning Problem
- AI doesn't distinguish between best practice and habit
- It can't tell if work was rushed or carefully considered
- It assumes everything we do works and starts repeating it
- Patterns scale without quality judgment

#### The Familiarity Trap: "AI Feels Like It Gets You"

**How AI Creates False Comfort**:
- Mirrors your voice and style
- Reproduces familiar structures
- Anticipates needs before you ask
- Creates reassuring familiarity

**The Cognitive Risks**:
1. **Processing Fluency**: We trust what's easy to understand and familiar
2. **Illusory Truth Effect**: Repeated exposure makes things feel more accurate
3. **Overconfidence**: Polished outputs bypass critical thinking

**Research-Specific Implications**:
- Clean charts and smooth writing feel more truthful
- Familiar logic flows gain unwarranted trust
- AI-generated themes may persist through repetition rather than evidence

#### Client Pressure and System Learning

**The Workflow Bias Problem**:
- AI learns from choices made under pressure
- It normalizes compromises meant to be temporary
- External pressure shapes internal standards
- Compromises become templates

**Examples of Problematic Learning**:
- Reusing decks without consideration
- Accepting "good enough" summaries
- Cutting corners due to tight timelines
- Letting client pressure override research judgment

### Practical Implications

#### What AI Learns From:
- Every approval and edit
- Shortcuts and compromises
- Workflow decisions under pressure
- What gets accepted without challenge

#### The Risk:
- Scaling our sloppiest moments
- Making compromises feel like standards
- Replacing thinking with pattern matching
- Building speed without building quality

#### The Opportunity:
- Being deliberate about what we model
- Showing the system what "good" looks like consistently
- Using each automation moment as a decision point
- Building clarity in early

### Recommended Practices

#### Quality Control Measures:
1. **Fresh Eyes Review**: Check outputs for tone, emphasis, and framing
2. **Question Familiarity**: If it reads exactly like you'd write it, ask why
3. **Challenge Comfort**: The most convincing outputs aren't always most correct
4. **Maintain Standards**: Don't let time pressure compromise what AI learns

#### Decision Framework:
Before accepting AI output, ask:
- Did I shape this, or did the tool learn what I let slide?
- Is this reflecting the data or just familiar patterns?
- Am I trusting this because it's good or because it's comfortable?

### Philosophy
**"Building faster systems without thinking about what they are learning is like designing a high-speed car without checking the brakes. Eventually, something gives."**

The goal isn't to slow down but to stay sharp‚Äîtreating each moment of automation as a decision point that shapes future capabilities.

*This script addresses the critical but often overlooked issue of how our work habits become AI training data, emphasizing the responsibility researchers have in shaping AI behavior through their own practices.*
