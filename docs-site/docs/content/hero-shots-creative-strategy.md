# Hero Shots

## **🎯 Hero Shot Strategy**

Each Hero Shot concept should:

1. **Show the outcome, not just the feature** (e.g., clarity, relief, speed)

2. **Mirror the user's day-to-day reality** (e.g., too many tabs, too much data, not enough time)

3. **Highlight Beings as the bridge** between chaos and clarity

## **📸 Hero Shot Concepts**

### **🧠 1\. “Insights That Speak for Themselves”**

**What it shows:**  
 A researcher in a busy workspace clicks on a transcript. Instantly, a sidebar opens with clear, structured themes — color-coded, auto-tagged, and framed as insights. On the other side of the screen: a stakeholder smiling, nodding in a meeting.

**JTBD aligned:**

* “Co-analyze with AI that knows my project”

* “Create stakeholder-specific outputs”

* “Prove the ROI of my research”

**Tagline:**  
 **“From transcript to takeaway — in minutes, not days.”**

### **⏱️ 2\. “Your Time Back, Your Focus Forward”**

**What it shows:**  
 Split screen: left side is a chaotic to-do list; right side shows Beings' AI capturing notes, timestamps, highlights, and to-dos from a recorded Zoom session — all hands-free. Researcher leans back, relaxed, coffee in hand.

**JTBD aligned:**

* “Stay present in sessions while tech handles the rest”

* “Prepare quickly without starting from scratch”

**Tagline:**  
 **“Stop scribbling. Start thinking.”**

---

### **🌍 3\. “Speak Human. Understand Everyone.”**

**What it shows:**  
 Multiple research participants from different regions speaking in varied dialects and accents. Beings transcribes and summarizes each flawlessly, with in-line nuance explanations (“Northern UK expression meaning...” etc.)

**JTBD aligned:**

* “Capture context and nuance accurately”

* “Reach global, diverse audiences with confidence”

**Tagline:**  
 **“Research that speaks every language. And listens too.”**

### **💬 4\. “Your AI Research Partner”**

**What it shows:**  
 A researcher chatting with an AI assistant inside the platform:

“Summarize this participant’s views on onboarding friction.”  
 “Compare responses across 3 sessions.”  
 “Draft a topline summary.”

The assistant responds instantly, citing exact quotes and links to time-stamped moments.

**JTBD aligned:**

* “Trust AI-assisted analysis with project context”

* “Reduce bias through collaborative synthesis”

**Tagline:**  
 **“Not just a tool. A thinking partner.”**

### **📊 5\. “Custom Reports That Win Over Stakeholders”**

**What it shows:**  
 Beings generating different versions of a report for:

1. a Head of Product (bullets and charts),

2. a CMO (highlighted quotes and branding insights),

3. a researcher (full depth \+ transcript links).

**JTBD aligned:**

* “Create stakeholder-specific outputs”

* “Justify the tools I choose to leadership”

**Tagline:**  
 **“One research story, many voices.”**

### **🔐 6\. “Research That’s Secure by Design”**

**What it shows:**  
 A visual showing recordings and transcripts encrypted, with options to anonymize quotes or export securely. A client’s legal/compliance officer giving the green light.

**JTBD aligned:**

* “Ensure participant data privacy”

* “Justify tool choices to leadership”

**Tagline:**  
 **“Trusted by researchers. Approved by compliance.”**
