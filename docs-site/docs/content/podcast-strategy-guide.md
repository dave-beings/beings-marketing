# What do you know?

# Email outreach sequence

Hi \[Name\],

I’ve just launched a podcast (YouTube/LinkedIn)—because the world clearly needs another one—but it’s already proving to be a great way to have deeper conversations with people doing interesting work. It’s also feeding some great material into my newsletter.

I’d love for you to be a guest.

Here’s the (low-lift) format I’ve been using:

Two short online sessions (30 mins each, about a week apart)

I’ll send over some suggested questions beforehand

Session 1: Casual brainstorm and role-play to shape the flow

I’ll refine things and share a final structure

Session 2: Quick warm-up, a short break, then we record a 7–10 min segment

I keep thinking about your work on the Truth Campaign and your take on ‘Analogue Skills in a Digital Age’—I think those would make a brilliant episode.

Would you be up for it?

Cheers,  
\[Your Name\]

Hi \[Name\],

I’ve been toying with the idea of starting a podcast (YouTube / LinkedIn) — because clearly what the world needs is another podcast... 😅

But honestly, the real goal is to have more great conversations with smart people across the industry — and to generate some useful material for writing my newsletter along the way.

Would you be up for being a guest? 

Here’s the rough plan:

* 2 x 30-minute online sessions (about a week apart, via Google Meet)  
* Session 1: A warm-up to brainstorm ideas, explore a few stories, and refine the conversation flow  
* Session 2: A quick tech check, short break, and then a relaxed 7–10 minute live recording

Some of the topics we might explore:

1. How did you get your start in the industry?  
2. What was your favorite job (or project), and why did it stand out?  
3. When did you first realise that AI would change the research landscape — or how do you see it shaping the future?  
4. What has had the biggest impact on your working life — or what’s better and harder about doing research today?  
5. Are there parts of the research process you think could be done differently or better? (i.e., If you could reimagine research using today’s tools, where would you start?)  
6. Can you think of a time in the past when the research industry underwent a major shift? (e.g., the rise of the internet, 9/11, mobile adoption, cloud computing, etc.)  
7. What’s the best piece of professional advice you’ve ever received?  
8. If listeners take away just one thing from our conversation today, what would you want it to be?

(We’ll keep it casual and flexible — it’s more about real conversations than scripted answers.)

Let me know if you’d be up for it — I’d really appreciate it and think it could be a lot of fun.

Thanks,  
Dave

# **📅 Calendar Invite 2: Live Recording Session**

**Title:**  
 *What Do You Know?* Podcast \- Live Recording

**Description:**  
 Hi \[Guest Name\],

This is our live recording session for *What Do You Know?* — a podcast about market research, insights, and the future of AI.

---

**Schedule:**

* 15 minutes: Warm-up conversation and quick tech check (audio, video, environment)

* 5 minutes: Short break to reset

* 25 minutes: Live podcast recording (targeting a relaxed but focused conversation)

---

**What We’ll Cover:**

* How you found your way into research

* A favorite project or insight that stayed with you

* When you first realized AI would change research (or how you see it influencing the future)

* What’s better and harder about doing research today

* Ideas for reimagining research processes with today's tools

* Lessons learned from past industry disruptions

* The best piece of advice you’ve ever received

* One future skill researchers should start building now

* One small action listeners should take after hearing your story

---

**What to Expect:**

* We’ll revisit highlights from our warm-up conversation and follow the natural flow of our discussion.

* We'll aim for an engaging, insightful conversation — more like a great research interview than a rigid Q\&A.

* Our AI Notetaker will also be running in the background to support post-production and summary work.

* We’ll keep it light, authentic, and fun — no need for polished “perfect” answers.

---

**Tech Tips for a Smooth Session:**

* If you can, plug your computer directly into your router with an Ethernet cable for a stronger connection.

* Headphones or a headset really help improve audio quality.

* Find a well-lit spot if possible — ideally with light in front of you (lighting from behind can make video tricky).

* If you can, gently ask family/housemates to ease off on Netflix downloads or big uploads during our session — but no worries if that's not possible\!

Excited to capture a great conversation together,

Discussion Guide

Yes — and I’m glad you asked, because they’re already strong but could become **exceptional** with a few careful improvements.  
 Here’s how we can **elevate** them:

---

## **🎯 5 Ways to Improve Your Podcast Questions**

### **1\. Make Some Questions Sharper and More Specific**

Instead of:

"How did you get your start in research?"

Use:

**"Was there a *moment* or project early on that made you realize, ‘this is what I want to do’? Tell us that story."**

✅ Why? It prompts a vivid story instead of a vague history lesson.

---

### **2\. Turn “Impact of Change” into a Before-and-After Reflection**

Instead of:

"What’s been the biggest shift since AI entered the space?"

Use:

**"What’s one part of your research practice that’s *better* because of AI — and one part that’s *harder*?"**

✅ Why? It forces contrast, which gives richer, more useful insights.

---

### **3\. Ask for a Playbook, Not Just Opinions**

Instead of:

"What parts of the research process are overdue for reinvention?"

Use:

**"If you could redesign one part of the research process from scratch today, where would you start — and how?"**

✅ Why? It encourages actionable ideas, not just abstract commentary.

---

### **4\. Use Future-Pacing to Drive Actionable Thinking**

Add something like:

**"Fast forward five years: What’s one skill researchers will *wish* they had developed today to thrive in an AI-driven industry?"**

✅ Why? It gives listeners a direct incentive to *prepare*, which increases the perceived value of the podcast.

---

### **5\. End Every Interview on a Call to Action**

Rather than just ending with best advice, ask:

**"If our listeners took one small action after hearing this episode, what should it be?"**

✅ Why? Helps listeners *apply* what they learned immediately, making your podcast a tool — not just entertainment.

---

## **✨ Improved Full Question Set**

Here’s how your *What Do You Know?* questions would sound after upgrading:

---

### **Opening**

* “Tell us a little about your path into research. Was there a moment when you knew this was *your* field?"

### **Personal**

* “What’s the favorite project you’ve worked on — and what made it stand out?"

### **Tipping Point**

* “When did it first hit you that AI wasn’t just another tech trend — but something that would reshape research itself?"

### **Change Reflection**

* "What's *better* and what's *harder* about doing research today compared to 5 years ago?"

### **Reinvention**

* "If you could redesign any part of the research process from scratch using today's tools — where would you start?"

### **Industry Lessons**

* "You've seen other big shifts before — how does the rise of AI compare to past disruptions like digitalization or economic crises?"

### **Best Advice**

* "What’s the best piece of professional advice you ever received — or something you live by?"

### **Future Skill**

* "Fast forward 5 years: what’s one skill researchers will *wish* they started building today?"

### **Actionable Close**

* "If listeners took one small action after hearing this conversation, what should it be?"
