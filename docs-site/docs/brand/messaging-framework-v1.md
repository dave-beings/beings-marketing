## One Minute Pitch

Beings is developing an AI-powered qualitative research platform to help researchers uncover deeper insights faster and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

We operate in the rapidly growing marketing technology market, currently valued at $325 billion and projected to grow at a 21% CAGR.

We are similar to Remesh and Discuss, but we differentiate ourselves by seamlessly integrating AI throughout the entire research process, from recruitment and analysis to reporting, while prioritising human expertise and ethical considerations.

Currently, we have a product in the market that was co-created with the research team at Google, and we are actively seeking user feedback to further refine and enhance its capabilities.

We are looking for seed funding to accelerate our product development, expand our team, and bring Beings to market, empowering researchers to unlock the full potential of their qualitative data.
