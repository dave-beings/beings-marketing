Anna’s message 

Hi [name]

I hope you are doing well? I’m reaching out as I am working on a research study focusing on the future of qualitative research and would love your input. 

We’re looking for experienced pros like you to help us understand the challenges and opportunities in this field, specifically how AI can be used to elevate how researchers spend their time and use their expertise to generate valuable insights at scale. 

Your input will be super valuable to shape a new AI tool that aims to enhance the research process, while keeping human intelligence at the centre. 

Here’s what I’m  planning:

What? A casual 30 min chat with me, researcher to researcher.
Where? Online video call via google meet.
When? Whenever works best for you this week
Why? I’d love to learn from your experiences and get your take on the current challenges and needs in your field. Plus as a thank you for your time, we’re offering a £20 Amazon voucher. 

If you’re interested in speaking with me, just reply here or you can use this link to book a time that works for you. 

https://calendly.com/scaleup-research/research-on-research 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

All the best, 
Anna
