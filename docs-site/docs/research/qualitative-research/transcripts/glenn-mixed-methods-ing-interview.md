- **Qualitative research**: Team members handle most user interviews
- **Tool implementation**: Leads research tool adoption and onboarding

## Research Tool Adoption Experience

### Condensed (Current Primary Tool)
- **Selection process**: Second attempt after initial evaluation years earlier
- **Alternative considered**: Dovetail (rejected due to legal/security concerns)
- **Key benefits**: 
  - German company (better for legal/security compliance)
  - Drag-and-drop split screen interface
  - Supports grounded theory/atomic research approach
  - Excellent affinity mapping capabilities

#### Condensed Workflow
- **Analysis approach**: Bottom-up, grounded theory methodology
- **Atomic research**: Every conclusion based on constituent parts and grounded in evidence
- **Tagging system**: Mixture of project-specific and global tags
- **Repository function**: Automatic side effect of good analysis and organization
- **Training documentation**: Created internal SharePoint guides for team use

### Tool Adoption Challenges at Enterprise Level

#### Legal and Security Hurdles
- **Timeline**: 6+ months for tool approval process
- **Committee reviews**: Multiple approval stages required
- **Compromise required**: Had to forego audio recording upload capabilities
- **Data residency**: Cannot send recordings to cloud services

#### Current Transcription Challenges
- **No direct recording upload**: Cannot send audio files to Condensed for transcription
- **Manual note-taking**: Required during sessions, challenging for many researchers
- **Teams transcription**: Poor quality, especially for Dutch language
- **Mac Whisper workaround**: Downloads OpenAI Whisper locally, but:
  - Takes 1+ hours to process
  - Requires significant computing power
  - Still produces poor quality Dutch transcriptions
  - Completely offline for GDPR compliance

### Research Process Workflow

#### Current Methodology
- **Audio-only recording**: QuickTime audio recordings (no video for security)
- **Live note-taking**: Required due to transcription limitations
- **Analysis in Condensed**: Using repository and analysis features
- **Mixed methods integration**: Seamless qual-to-quant transitions

#### Team Capabilities
- **Experienced researchers**: Can take notes while maintaining participant engagement
- **Junior researchers**: Struggle with simultaneous note-taking and interviewing
- **Skill development**: Ongoing coaching to build dual-task capabilities

## Enterprise Research Context

### Organizational Structure
- **Large enterprise**: Complex approval processes and security requirements
- **Multi-country operations**: Research across different ING markets
- **Team growth**: Recently hired German psychology PhD for quantitative support
- **Method expansion**: Organization increasingly embracing mixed methods

### Security and Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR compliance**: Strict data handling requirements
- **No cloud uploads**: Cannot send sensitive data to external services
- **Local processing**: All transcription must happen on-premises
- **Client consent**: Participants agree to specific recording limitations

### Research Infrastructure Needs
- **Repository requirements**: Central storage for research artifacts
- **Analysis tools**: Support for grounded theory and atomic research approaches
- **Transcription solutions**: Accurate, multi-language, GDPR-compliant options
- **Training resources**: Documentation and guides for team development

## AI and Technology Perspective

### Current AI Tool Experience
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Using locally-downloaded version for transcription
- **Condensed AI features**: Some automated capabilities in repository tool
- **Transcription challenges**: AI still inadequate for Dutch language accuracy

### Enterprise AI Adoption Barriers
- **Security concerns**: Cannot use cloud-based AI services
- **Data residency**: Must keep all data within organizational boundaries
- **Compliance requirements**: GDPR and financial services regulations
- **Quality standards**: AI outputs must meet research accuracy requirements

### Potential AI Applications
- **Local transcription**: Better offline AI transcription capabilities
- **Analysis support**: AI-assisted pattern recognition and theme identification
- **Multi-language support**: Improved non-English language processing
- **Repository intelligence**: Smarter search and categorization features

## Research Quality and Methodology

### Grounded Theory Approach
- **Bottom-up analysis**: Building insights from evidence up
- **Atomic research**: Granular, evidence-based conclusions
- **Systematic tagging**: Consistent taxonomy for cross-project insights
- **Affinity mapping**: Visual organization of research findings

### Mixed Methods Integration
- **Seamless transitions**: Moving fluidly between qual and quant
- **Complementary insights**: Using each method to inform the other
- **Strategic method selection**: Choosing right approach for each research question
- **Team skill development**: Building capabilities across methodologies

## Key Challenges and Pain Points

### Primary Challenges
1. **Transcription quality**: Poor AI transcription for Dutch language
2. **Enterprise security**: Cannot use cloud-based AI tools
3. **Workflow inefficiency**: Manual note-taking during interviews
4. **Tool adoption timeline**: 6+ month approval processes
5. **Team capability gaps**: Not all researchers can take notes while interviewing

### Process Inefficiencies
- **Manual transcription**: Time-intensive and error-prone
- **Limited tool options**: Security requirements eliminate many solutions
- **Workflow fragmentation**: Different solutions for different aspects
- **Training overhead**: Extensive documentation needed for tool adoption

## Strategic Implications for Beings

### Enterprise Opportunities
1. **GDPR-compliant AI**: Local processing capabilities for European markets
2. **Multi-language support**: Better transcription for non-English languages
3. **Enterprise security**: On-premises or private cloud deployment options
4. **Mixed methods support**: Tools that work for both qual and quant research

### Key Requirements
- **Local data processing**: No cloud uploads of sensitive data
- **Regulatory compliance**: GDPR and financial services requirements
- **Multi-language accuracy**: Especially Dutch, German, and other European languages
- **Enterprise integration**: Ability to work within complex IT environments

### User Profile Insights
- **Sophisticated user**: Advanced mixed methods researcher
- **Tool evaluator**: Responsible for organizational tool adoption
- **Process optimizer**: Creates workflows and training for teams
- **Compliance-conscious**: Highly aware of security and regulatory requirements

## Key Quotes

### On Tool Selection Process
*"We went with a German company Condensed... Dovetail was too American for our legal and security departments."*

### On Enterprise Adoption Challenges
*"In order to have it only six months and not take 12 months, we had to forego the ability to send actual recordings to Condensed to have it transcribed."*

### On Current Transcription Challenges
*"Even the Whisper LLM for transcription is still awful for Dutch... I don't have a good solution for that."*

### On Research Approach
*"The way I do qualitative analysis in a very grounded theory kind of bottom-up way... they call that Atomic research - every conclusion is based on its constituent parts and grounded in evidence."*

### On Enterprise Security Requirements
*"The client has signed for this... they wouldn't want us to send anything to the cloud. I can literally turn off my internet - that makes it very safe and very GDPR nice."*
