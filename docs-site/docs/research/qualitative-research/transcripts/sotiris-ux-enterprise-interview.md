- **Customer Base**: Internal teams and engineers
- **Platform Development**: Creating internal monitoring and alerting platforms

### Research Philosophy
- **Product-focused approach**: Research to make product decisions, not academic knowledge
- **Evidence-based decisions**: Reliable, valid insights that influence product direction
- **KPI-driven**: Research connected to measurable business outcomes
- **Bridge role**: Connecting research insights to design and engineering teams

## Research Methodology & Process

### Strategic Framework

#### Research Planning Process
1. **Roadmap Planning**: Team sets goals and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
2. **KPI Connection**: Reverse engineer from KPIs to identify user problems
3. **Assumption Mapping**: Connect specific assumptions to each KPI
4. **Research Questions**: Transform assumptions into study questions
5. **Methodology Selection**: Choose approaches based on business objectives

#### Impact Measurement
- **Lagging Indicators**: Metrics that show impact 6 months post-release
- **Leading Indicators**: Early signals that predict future impact
- **Challenge**: Balancing immediate insights with long-term outcomes

### Research Types & Outputs

#### Evaluative Research (Easier to Act On)
- **Usability testing**: Concrete list of issues and improvements
- **Tangible outputs**: "This doesn't work, this label is confusing"
- **Team adoption**: Quick and fast absorption by teams
- **Actionable nature**: Clear next steps for implementation

#### Generative Research (More Complex)
- **User interviews**: Deep contextual understanding
- **Contextual inquiries**: Observational research
- **Complex outputs**: Difficult for teams to immediately act upon
- **Processing required**: Need distillation from observations to actionable insights

### Analysis Process: Three-Step Framework

#### Step 1: Observations
- Raw data collection from research activities
- Direct user feedback and behavioral observations
- Contextual information gathering

#### Step 2: Findings
- Pattern identification across observations
- Grouping and categorization of data
- Initial synthesis of research data

#### Step 3: Insights
- **"Majority of our work"**: Most time-intensive phase
- Transformation of findings into actionable recommendations
- Connection to business objectives and KPIs
- Strategic implications for product development

## Key Quotes

### On Research Purpose
*"We're not doing it for the sake of knowledge. We're doing research to create products, to make product decisions that are solid, reliable, and help the team use evidence to make product decisions."*

### On Analysis Challenges
*"The majority of our work [is the] three-step process: observations to findings to insights. The most important part is making sure insights are actionable."*

### On Generative Research Complexity
*"What's tricky is the outcome of generative research... It's very difficult for teams to just take it and do something with it. That's where researchers need to distill information."*

### On Impact Measurement
*"The hardest thing in many product teams is to create leading indicators - things we will know today which will indicate that something has impacted or will change eventually."*
