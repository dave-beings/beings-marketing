- **Background**: History degree, trend forecasting, government research, now running own agency

## Interview Context
- **Interviewer**: Anna (User Research Lead, Scale Up Collective)
- **Purpose**: Understanding researcher needs for AI research tool development (Beings platform)
- **Format**: Remote video interview
- **Recording**: Multiple recording tools used (including Beings platform demo)

## Key Background & Experience

### Career Journey
1. **Trend Forecasting**: Started at Protein (magazine/youth culture agency)
2. **Graduate Scheme**: Populous (now Yonder Consulting) - qual research team
3. **Criminal Justice**: Senior Research Officer at charity (brief stint)
4. **Government Research**: Lead User Researcher during COVID

   - HMRC (Brexit customs)
   - Defra (XL Bully Dogs ban research)
5. **Current**: Own agency (New Bureau) - mostly magazine clients like The Face

### Research Methodology Experience
- **Face-to-face research**: Extensive experience with focus groups and in-depth interviews
- **Online research**: Adapted during pandemic, now primary method
- **Government UX research**: Large-scale user testing and service design
- **Mixed methods**: Both qualitative and quantitative experience

## Research Methodology Insights

### Face-to-Face vs. Online Research

#### Benefits of Face-to-Face Research
- **Contextual understanding**: Can observe participant's environment, body language, neighborhood
- **Richer insights**: Captures incidental observations missed in online research
- **Focus group efficiency**: Quick consensus building, efficient for multiple groups
- **Personal engagement**: More exciting and engaging for researcher

#### Viewing Facilities (Traditional Research Labs)
- **Historical context**: Two-way mirrors, clients observing from behind
- **Examples**: Home Sweet Home in Covent Garden, London
- **Current status**: Many facilities closing due to shift to online research
- **Comparison**: User research "labs" vs. traditional "viewing facilities"

### Analysis Methodology

#### Preferred Analysis Method: Content Grid Analysis
- **Tool**: Pen and paper (traditional approach)
- **Process**: Grid with respondents on one side, topic areas across top
- **Benefits**: Visual pattern recognition, cross-tabulation capabilities
- **Collaboration**: Always involves multiple researchers to reduce bias

#### Analysis Workflow
1. **Content grid creation**: Manual mapping of responses
2. **Collaborative analysis**: Never analyze alone - involves other researchers
3. **Post-it note theming**: Classic wall-based theme development
4. **Discursive insights**: Insights emerge through discussion between researchers
5. **Storyboarding**: Hand-drawn A3 storyboards for presentation flow

### Presentation & Storytelling

#### Story Structure Approach
- **Headline continuity**: Each slide headline reads as connected narrative
- **Story flow**: Headlines form coherent paragraph when read sequentially
- **Two research purposes**: 
  1. Validation research (proving existing ideas)
  2. Discovery research (finding something new)

#### Alternative Presentation Formats
- **Audio clips**: Using actual participant voices instead of quotes
- **Film production**: 10-minute research films for organizational sharing
- **Visual storytelling**: More engaging than traditional PowerPoint

## Current Challenges in Qualitative Research

### Primary Challenges
1. **Client Buy-in**: Convincing clients to invest in qualitative research
2. **Quantification pressure**: Industry shift toward data-driven approaches
3. **Recruitment**: Finding right participants for research objectives
4. **Budget constraints**: Securing adequate funding for quality research

### Industry Shifts
- **Tech industry influence**: Preference for large-scale user data over small-sample qual
- **Skepticism about small samples**: "Why do focus groups with 16 people when we have data from 200,000?"
- **Methodological bias**: Increasing preference for quantitative approaches

## Technology and AI Perspectives

### Current Tool Usage
- **Traditional tools**: Pen and paper for analysis
- **Digital platforms**: Experience with Inkling, Recollective (online community tools)
- **Preference**: Manual methods over technology-driven approaches

### AI Tool Concerns
- **Job displacement**: "Don't want to talk myself out of a job"
- **Cultural barriers**: Research should be about people, not technology
- **Personal philosophy**: Values human connection and traditional methods

### Potential AI Applications
- **Analysis support**: Could see AI helping with content grid analysis
- **Pattern recognition**: AI might identify themes and cross-tabulations
- **Time savings**: Could automate repetitive analysis tasks

## Client and Market Context

### Current Client Base
- **Magazine industry**: The Face magazine (primary client)
- **Research type**: Brand lift studies, more quantitative focus
- **Business model**: Solo agency with freelancer network
- **Challenges**: New to agency management, learning business operations

### Market Observations
- **Viewing facility closures**: Traditional research infrastructure disappearing
- **Online research dominance**: Pandemic accelerated permanent shift
- **User research framing**: Industry moving toward UX/digital focus
- **Economic drivers**: Cost and efficiency prioritized over methodology

## Key Quotes and Insights

### On Face-to-Face Research Value
*"Getting a picture of who you are and where you live and what your neighborhood is like... what your body language is really like... all of that stuff is lost in online research."*

### On Analysis Collaboration
*"I was always taught never do analysis on your own... everybody brings a certain bias... insights really emerge through discussion."*

### On Research Purpose
*"Most projects fall into one of two categories: you're either trying to prove to a stakeholder who already has an idea... or you are really trying to find out something new."*

### On Industry Changes
*"There's been a shift towards a kind of more quantified approach in research... led by the tech industry because they get a lot of data from their users."*

## Strategic Implications for Beings

### Opportunities
- **Analysis automation**: Support for content grid analysis and pattern recognition
- **Collaboration tools**: Digital tools that maintain human collaboration benefits
- **Storytelling support**: Help create compelling narratives from research data
- **Time savings**: Automate repetitive tasks while preserving human insight

### Considerations
- **Traditional researcher concerns**: Need to address job displacement fears
- **Methodology respect**: Honor traditional research methods while adding AI value
- **Human-centered approach**: Position AI as enhancement, not replacement
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Acknowledge and respect established research practices

---

*This interview provides valuable insights into traditional qualitative research practices and the perspective of experienced researchers on AI tool adoption. The participant represents a segment of researchers who value traditional methods but may be open to AI assistance that enhances rather than replaces human expertise.*
