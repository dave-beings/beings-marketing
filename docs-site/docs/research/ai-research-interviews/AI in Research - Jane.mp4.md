  
**Speaker 0 (3:45 \- 10:19:45):** Oh yeah, this is much better. Okay. Hi. Thank you very much for connecting. Uh, I'm gri, I'm a product manager in the research and insights at, uh, at a startup called Beings. Uh, we are developing a AI product for market research and, uh, oversee o Dave. He will not be joining today. Uh, he has another meeting and, uh, we have another participant chair called ada. Uh, it's a tool developed by our company that will be recording the meeting and it'll give transcript at the end. So it is just for the note taking purpose. Are you fine with that? Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (10:19:45 \- 10:37:05):** That's fine. Thank you. 

**Speaker 0 (10:46:55 \- 15:52:25):** Okay. Right. Thanks a lot. So, yeah, uh, we can start with the, you, you, you can explain a little bit more about your job, that what kind of job are you doing now and, uh, what are your day-to-Day responsibilities. And, uh, then I can start asking, uh, uh, more tailored questions about the next steps, please. 

**Speaker 1 (15:56:55 \- 27:23:05):** Yeah, sure. So, um, I've just started a new job. Um, so, uh, it's a bit TBC, um, but, um, I work in Insights team, um, uh, it for gaming, um, uh, and basically we employ other research agencies to conduct the research in terms of writing the questionnaires and finding the people, um, and giving us a report. And then it's up to us to sort of action that, um, and, uh, go out to the stakeholders within the business and answer their questions essentially. 

**Speaker 0 (28:10:45 \- 32:19:15):** Right. Thanks. And, uh, in, in, in your current job, but yeah, firstly, congratulations on your new job. Thank you. And, and this job or, or the recent one, uh, have you been using, uh, AI tools to, to for, for your work? 

**Speaker 1 (32:40:15 \- 44:07:55):** Um, not hugely actually in my, so my last job was in a research agency, um, and they were, they created an AI sector of the, of the business. Um, so that was just sort of getting going as I, as I left. Um, so they did sort of, um, some AI stuff for projects in terms of, uh, social media, um, understanding what people were talking about for different brands and that sort of thing. Um, and I know in my current job there is a desire to use more, but I don't think it's used that much currently. Okay. 

**Speaker 0 (44:29:35 \- 48:57:55):** And, and for that social media listening, uh, were they already like, uh, getting data from different kind of website or the, the website that are storing cookies information and uh, and you don't have to talk to anybody to get that information? Or how, how were you recording the data? 

**Speaker 1 (49:13:35 \- 51:22:05):** Um, so it wasn't me that was, was doing it, so I couldn't say specifically, but I know we spoke to people. It was, um, via tools, I think. 

**Speaker 0 (51:52:25 \- 55:48:55):** Right. Okay. Thanks. And, uh, and, and at your current job, uh, uh, are you, what, what's the nature of, uh, the work? Is it like mostly qualitative research? Uh, job or you will be doing quantitative part? Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (55:55:25 \- 56:03:35):** Quantum, 

**Speaker 0 (56:31:55 \- 56:54:15):** Uh, sorry, can you repeat again? 

**Speaker 1 (57:04:55 \- 57:22:15):** Quant, it was mainly quant. 

**Speaker 0 (58:13:05 \- 58:33:05):** Quantitative You mean 

**Speaker 1 (58:39:05 \- 58:57:05):** Quantitative? Yeah, 

**Speaker 0 (59:06:35 \- 67:27:05):** Sorry. Okay. Yeah, again, I, I you voice is coming after, after your started to delay. Uh, no worries. Uh, okay. So for, okay, I'm just trying to understand. I can, the previous job, uh, uh, your company, they started to explore ai. Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>, but were not, uh, directly involved there. Use then. Yeah. And can, can you explain a little bit more about the nature of your job there? What was your responsibilities there and, uh, 

**Speaker 1 (67:39:05 \- 81:51:55):** Yeah, sure. So, um, in the agency I was sort of responsible for running projects for clients. So, um, we have a project that we'll be trying to answer a specific question, for example. Um, and I would have a small team on that project. We would write a questionnaire, then we would script that, so put it into an online survey, um, and then we would find the right people to answer it using panel suppliers. Uh, then we would process the data, um, taking it from raw data into, um, Excel or other software analysis tools that we used. Um, and then we would create a report and present it back. That was kind of the lifecycle of a, of a project there. And we would do that 6, 7, 8 projects at a time. 

**Speaker 0 (82:14:05 \- 83:21:05):** Oh, wow. And, uh, how many people were like working on a single project? 

**Speaker 1 (83:43:25 \- 84:11:05):** Uh, a team was usually two or three, 

**Speaker 0 (84:28:15 \- 86:11:15):** Two or three people on the same project. And you were basically managing the whole seven eight project at the same time. Yeah, 

**Speaker 0 (86:30:25 \- 95:14:35):** Yeah. That seems very complex and very interesting. So how, how, how are you managing that? Uh, if you have to walk me through the, your whole product journey, like in the beginning you're just thinking about a product, then you're planning and then you're deciding that what kind of data you have to collect, what kind of people you have to talk to and uh, how to provide the resources, uh, to your team. Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. So were you using like a different tools for all of these different steps or how much of this was automated? And can, can you please walk me through your Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (95:15:05 \- 110:00:55):** Nothing is, nothing's automated. Um, so in terms of sort of designing the questions that we asked, that's all manual from the team. Um, we then, uh, as I say, work with panel suppliers who find the right people, um, for us to, uh, speak to. So say if we only wanted to speak to people between the ages of 2030, then they would find those people, um, and then we would sort of manage the field work and check that were getting the right people and the right number. Um, and then we would get the data back from them in sort of a raw format. Um, and as I say, we turned that into sort of tables, so it was the right, uh, sort of codes and different cross breaks that had different populations in. Um, and then the creation of the report was manual as well. 

**Speaker 0 (110:19:35 \- 112:51:35):** Hmm, right. Interesting. And, uh, the nature of those project was also mostly quantitative or that there, there was a bit of qualitative research involved as well. 

**Speaker 1 (112:59:25 \- 113:40:55):** Sometimes they were mixed, but my role was quantitative. 

**Speaker 0 (114:01:25 \- 116:41:15):** Okay. Okay. So yeah, the, for the overall product completion, there were parts of qualitative as well, but you were mostly focusing on quantitative side. 

**Speaker 1 (116:54:15 \- 118:05:15):** Yes, uh, yes. Some were solely quantitative, but some had quality as well. 

**Speaker 0 (118:18:05 \- 124:29:15):** Right. Thanks. Yeah, that's very interesting. And if for let, let's say, if we have to do out to the broader picture, uh, where do you see AI could have helped you? Uh, I, I mean also product management side plus also quantitative research side, like hands-on session. Do you see that, uh, there are some areas where you could have benefited from ai? 

**Speaker 1 (124:48:15 \- 148:45:25):** Yeah, definitely. I think in the sort of the questionnaire development stage, it would be very useful. Um, so if I give you an example, if we were working with a supermarket, it's probably a bad example 'cause everyone knows the supermarkets, but, um, and we wanted to know what their main competitors were or what people were talking about when they are talking about that supermarket, understanding sort of what's out there already would be very helpful in terms of the language that people are using. Um, so this is something that we, where we did use the AI capabilities at our company to find the sort of what we call the brand list, so the other brands to ask about as well as the, the main one that we are talking about. Um, so that was, that was really useful in, in all honesty, I'm not a hundred percent on AI's full capabilities. I'm sure there's probably roles for it at every stage. Um, there is also, you obviously can do like automated reporting. Um, so, uh, sort of if I want a bar chart of this data, um, then having that automated, um, I know that is possible in some forms now, but it's quite a manual process to get it set up. Um, so if there was a way to make that easier, then I think that would be quite a good role for AI as well. 

**Speaker 0 (149:31:25 \- 152:52:05):** So, sorry, if I understood correctly, is uh, like data analysis part, you mean the understanding your data or transcriptions or like the voice breaking on my side? 

**Speaker 1 (153:05:55 \- 160:02:05):** Yeah, actually you just reminded me of something, but I actually more meant the actual creation of like a, like we do write reports, so the visuals of it and more meant the creation of that. Um, but what you just said there is manage me, we quite often have like what we call open-end questions, so, uh, people can type in whatever they want. So, um, automatic coding and sort of sentiment analysis of that, um, is something that's really useful. 

**Speaker 0 (160:29:15 \- 166:57:55):** Yeah, right. Interesting. And, uh, at the end of your data analysis, uh, what are the usual form of representation of data? How do you, uh, are there like some common ways you always present your data? Uh, like in PPT presentation, but also including tables and spreadsheets or how do you use the \<crosstalk\>? It's 

**Speaker 1 (166:57:55 \- 167:27:55):** Pretty much mostly PowerPoint. 

**Speaker 0 (167:49:25 \- 172:47:05):** Mostly PowerPoint. And, uh, okay. And, uh, when you say that, uh, a lot of people are using ai, but you're not a hundred percent into it, is it like a, uh, an any trust issue with ai? What is, uh, holding you or, or, or this is something you would start exploring more? 

**Speaker 1 (173:05:35 \- 176:56:45):** It's probably, um, a lack of knowledge of what's actually available. Yeah. Maybe, um, like I don't really know what can be done. 

**Speaker 0 (177:14:05 \- 177:18:55):** Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (177:48:05 \- 177:58:55):** That makes sense. 

**Speaker 0 (178:13:15 \- 183:15:35):** No, sure, sure. Yeah, that, that, that's totally sensible because not everybody is trying to, uh, jump onto the latest technology available. It's like, unless we are very clear that how is it going to benefit me, and sometime we can explore it by ourself or sometime your company can force you that we are moving to this tool and study. 

**Speaker 1 (183:33:25 \- 183:38:15):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (183:49:15 \- 187:23:35):** And do you feel that kind of, uh, need or, uh, uh, you know, suggestions coming from your company's point of view that we should use more AI or, or your bit more independent on your side that you can manage in whatever way you feel? 

**Speaker 1 (187:36:05 \- 195:18:45):** Okay. I think from, from, obviously as I said, I, I've only just joined my current company, but um, there does seem to be desire to use more ai Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, um, I think to, you know, make things more efficient. And, um, there's lots of data in lots of different places in my current company. Um, so you know, a way to consolidate that, that sort of stuff I think is what, um, is looked for, uh, but not there yet. 

**Speaker 0 (195:44:55 \- 202:56:05):** Right. Yeah. Thanks. And, uh, so, uh, okay, for the moment, when you're not using AI a lot for different steps of your, your product, can you tell me the names of some of the tool, like from the beginning, from product planning to data recording, data collection and data analysis, towards the end when you're sharing these, what are the different tools that you're using for different stages? 

**Speaker 1 (203:09:45 \- 214:05:15):** Yeah, sure. So I'll, I'll go back to my previous job because I think that's probably more usable. Um, but, uh, some of it's not fancy at all. Um, so like when we're writing our questionnaire, we are just doing that in a Word document. Um, then when we are, uh, scripting it, so putting it online, it's into, um, in software called the Cipher. Um, then, uh, when we are doing the data processing at the backend, it's software called Merlin or Merlin Co. Um, and then, uh, we use Excel and uh, key research and then PowerPoint. 

**Speaker 0 (214:44:55 \- 226:25:45):** Okay. Yep. PowerPoint at the end. And, uh, the information that goes into PowerPoint, I believe that for same product you would be talking to different kind of, uh, uh, people at the end of the project, maybe sometime discussing it with your team where you can have more technical discussion. Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. And then maybe at some point you're also talking to more management people where you will be talking to high level language. So yeah. Uh, or are, are there only these two cases are there, or, or can you explain me a little bit more that, uh, how many different kind of expertise were available on the target side where you have to, uh, you know, rephrase your slides or PPT, uh, every time to talk about the same project? 

**Speaker 1 (226:48:25 \- 242:22:35):** Yeah, um, probably at a high level, what you said is, is correct. It, we will usually find out the audience before we are creating the report and gear it to that specific audience. Um, so quite often we'll be doing one report, but it will only be suitable for one audience, and that might be a research audience. Um, but then for us it's then not applicable or useful to take that to the wider team, like product teams or marketing teams because it's too research specific. Um, so I would say the, the two sort of high level buckets that you said there, where you're speaking a bit more technically or where you're speaking a bit more high level and it needs to be condensed and, um, a bit more succinct, I would say. Yeah, those are the two main things. 

**Speaker 0 (242:44:15 \- 246:41:15):** And, uh, do you think, uh, some sort of automation or AI could help you there with the data representation? Sorry, forgetting it right way for data visualization for target specific audience? 

**Speaker 1 (246:59:45 \- 253:09:25):** Yeah, I mean, definitely if there was sort of a, an option for this is this is all the data that we've got for like the more technical, um, details team and then thinking, simplify that and just pull out X, Y, Z or simplify the language that has been used. If that's, if that's a possibility, then I think that would be, that would be useful. 

**Speaker 0 (253:40:25 \- 256:25:25):** And, and, and how do you, can, can you tell me the names of some tools that you use to, uh, for data visualization of, uh, quantitative data, let's say when you have to that 

**Speaker 1 (256:30:45 \- 259:09:25):** I need to be honest. It's just, it's just PowerPoint and we just create charts or visuals or images or whatever within, within PowerPoint. We don't use tools to do it. 

**Speaker 0 (259:31:25 \- 263:04:05):** So, uh, okay. So, so the data format before that is like Excel sheets. Yeah. And, uh, you manually, uh, get figures and plots in PowerPoint from just Excel sheet. 

**Speaker 1 (263:16:25 \- 263:21:15):** Yeah, 

**Speaker 0 (263:28:15 \- 266:25:55):** That's it. Uh, is, is there any other type of data format that you might have received and, uh, you needed to get like, some meaningful trend from that data other than Excel sheets? 

**Speaker 1 (266:44:55 \- 273:16:35):** Um, not really. We tend, we tended to put everything in Excel or the other research software that I mentioned, Q Research, um, that was sort of done, like that's its own separate package like program, but then you'd export it to Excel. So everything sort of in the end came from Excel forward to then populate our PowerPoint. 

**Speaker 0 (273:45:25 \- 277:52:35):** Right. Yeah. Thanks. So do you think that, uh, the nature of your job or the tools you were using in your previous job would continue in, in, in your current job as well? Or you have to like learn new kind of tools now and structurally change? Um, 

**Speaker 1 (278:08:25 \- 286:21:35):** No, I think it'll be fairly, I think it'll be fairly similar, to be honest. I think, um, yeah, from what I've seen, PowerPoint is, uh, one of the main things We do also sometimes use Google Slides, um, yeah, which I'm not a huge fan of because I think they're quite inefficient and fiddly. Um, but, uh, yeah, so, so that's why we most of the time use PowerPoint. But if there was a way to make Google Slides better, \<laugh\>, I'm sure that would be good. 

**Speaker 0 (286:39:14 \- 288:44:54):** So, so, so, so why do you think that's inefficient? Because a lot of people like it so you can collaborate, uh, at the same time in Google Slides. 

**Speaker 1 (288:52:44 \- 300:31:25):** Yeah, that's definitely a positive, um, of it, but you could do that in like SharePoint or other, like, I don't have to be on Google Slides to be able to do that. Um, it's things like you can't copy and paste the charts from like one side to another. You have to recreate them. Um, the capabilities on Google Slides are not as, um, strong as in PowerPoint themselves. It's harder to actually work with. It takes, it just takes more time. It's more fiddly, um, to sort of align things or make them look nice. Um, and yeah, just generally I don't think it's as good a program as working in PowerPoint for what we, what we need to do. 

**Speaker 0 (300:38:55 \- 308:59:15):** Right. Yeah. Thanks. And, uh, so you have briefly mentioned, uh, sentiment analysis about qualitative analysis. Like, uh, you want to get some kind of information from ai. Uh, uh, would you like to tell me a little bit more that, uh, what is your, let's say in idealistic scenario when there is no problem with technology, uh, what would be your wishlist, uh, for AI to what, what kind of information you want to get out of qualitative analysis with the help of ai? 

**Speaker 1 (309:12:05 \- 329:47:25):** So most of the time what we're doing with that is grouping it into themes. So if we ask for example, someone why they like a certain product or an idea that we've shown them, what ultimately what I want to know is have half the people sent the same thing or is there 20 different things that all get equal mentions? So being able to understand what the theme is and the size of that theme within the, within the number of participants that we have. Those are the, those are the two main things. Um, and sort of understanding whether people's, 'cause this is something I think is currently missing. I can't think of an example off the top of my head, but the context and the tone can sometimes be positive and sometimes be negative. And I think that sometimes is missed. Um, with, with current, with current tools or whatever that we've been, that we've been using, um, complexities of the English language I guess. But, um, yeah, that, that's ultimately what we want to know. We want to know the themes of what people have said and how we would then categorize them as if, as if we'd ask them that on a list for them to choose from. We then want to be able to take everything that they have said and turn it into that list essentially. 

**Speaker 0 (330:01:45 \- 334:31:25):** Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. Right. Yeah. Thanks. Very interesting. And, uh, in your work, uh, are you happy with if, uh, AI is just speaking in English language or do you often come across the need of a translation to different languages? 

**Speaker 1 (334:52:45 \- 347:24:05):** I mean, I think, um, I only speak English, so I don't need anything else. But in terms of that, um, we do do research in other markets. So for that example, um, that I was just saying, if I've asked an open-ended question, obviously when we get the data back on sort of coded questions, then it's fine because all the codes match up. But if it's a verbatim response, then I have no idea what has been said. Um, so, um, in previous projects we have like outsourced it to agencies, translation agencies for them to then translate it and for them we would then look through it. Um, so, or yeah, automatic translation, um, of those would be useful. 

**Speaker 0 (347:49:35 \- 354:21:05):** Right, thanks. And, uh, let's say that AI is giving you, uh, this information about thematic analysis or it's giving you centimeter analysis and trying to, uh, give you as clear message as possible, uh, where human will take more time. Uh, will you trust it or if not, then uh, what would be your deciding factor to trust it? 

**Speaker 1 (354:47:25 \- 355:09:55):** Trust the translations, you mean? 

**Speaker 0 (355:28:25 \- 358:27:15):** Well, not just the translation, like the key insight that you're getting, like the sentiment analysis or thematic analysis, like the output of the qualitative analysis. Um, what would it take for you? 

**Speaker 1 (358:49:55 \- 366:20:25):** I think, yeah, I think I would, I think I would trust it. Um, my, my hesitation would be more on translations. 'cause I don't think \<inaudible\> translation are that good currently. Um, but uh, in terms of the sentiment analysis, I can't think why. I wouldn't trust that. I probably would trust that if it was, um, grouping into, into themes, I feel like there's only so much that can go wrong there. 

**Speaker 0 (367:12:05 \- 375:55:05):** Right. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. And, uh, what do you think about, uh, ethical complications? Do you, uh, are, are you concerned with the, any ethical, uh, complications that might come with the, the rise of AI for your data analysis and data recording? Or is there any obvious issue that could be a deciding factor for you that can make you a user or can make you hate AI forever? 

**Speaker 1 (376:14:25 \- 396:53:25):** \<laugh\>? Um, yeah, I guess, and actually just, sorry, just going back on what I just said, that the issue I think of where you need the human context is on that, is on the, on the tone and interpretation. So what I, basically, what I was saying before probably would be an issue of trust in terms of are people saying whatever they said in a positive light or in a, in a negative light. Um, and I think that there's, there's only so much that AI can do with that currently. Um, and I think it, it misses the, the nuance of what people have said when you sort of, uh, bring it back to the basics of this word means x because sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it changes depending on the context or the tone in which people have said it. Um, so I think that's what would make me skeptical would be missing out on the, on the nuance of, of what is actually being said. 

**Speaker 0 (397:07:05 \- 402:52:05):** Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. Right. Yeah. Thanks. And, uh, in terms of tools, uh, AI related tools, uh, can you tell me how, what, what have you used so far when you, when you say ai, uh, what comes to your mind and what's, uh, your experience of, uh, just the name of some tools? 

**Speaker 1 (403:06:25 \- 413:24:05):** So the o the only one that we have used for that specific example was the Q research, um, software that I mentioned. They have like an automatic, uh, coding. Um, and then there is something that we have used very specifically, um, for communities called the leader. They have sentiment analysis in there. Um, other than that, for work purposes, I don't think I've used anything. I mean track DBT obviously, but not specifically to, for any of the, the project stages that I've sort of spoken about really. 

**Speaker 0 (413:32:35 \- 416:13:45):** Yeah. So when, when you talk about, uh, coding, automatic coding in Q research, you are still talking about coding in qualitative research and not the programming languages, right? 

**Speaker 1 (416:30:15 \- 417:46:05):** Sorry? Yes. Yeah, coding, we, we say coding sort of up into themes. 

**Speaker 0 (417:57:15 \- 419:36:05):** Sure, sure. Yeah. And, uh, about the sentiment analysis, the name of the tool is leaders 

**Speaker 1 (420:00:45 \- 421:32:05):** A Leader, um, but it, that's not, it's, that's not the function of it. It's 

**Speaker 0 (421:32:05 \- 422:18:45):** Oh, yeah. That, that's a separate tool, I think a leader. Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (422:25:15 \- 424:02:05):** Yeah. Um, it has that option within it, but that's very much not the main function of a leader. 

**Speaker 0 (424:28:35 \- 425:31:35):** And what, what are the other function that, uh, you like in a leader other than, 

**Speaker 1 (425:31:55 \- 430:17:55):** Oh, the main, the main function of it is that it's sort of a, um, a community platform. So you can build communities of people and do research with them. That's the main function of it. Um, but yeah, within that there is this option of doing sentiment analysis, basically. 

**Speaker 0 (430:21:35 \- 433:00:35):** Oh, so is it like when you want to continue some project and, uh, those are your participant and, uh, you can build your community there, but how do you, how do you find those people then? 

**Speaker 1 (433:21:35 \- 437:56:35):** So it, it depends really. You find them sort of outside, usually using whoever your client is. They might have like a, a customer database and you would contact them and ask them if they want to be part of that community. Um, but it kind of depends on who your client is as to how you find them. 

**Speaker 0 (438:11:05 \- 441:17:55):** Yeah. And have you ever come across a project where your clients are not giving you the list of customer data? They just give you a list of questions that they want answers to, and do you have find participant on your own? 

**Speaker 1 (441:31:15 \- 442:47:15):** I personally haven't had that. No. I'm sure, sure it happens, but I haven't had that \<laugh\>. 

**Speaker 0 (443:01:05 \- 454:43:15):** Okay. Right. Yeah. Thanks. And just, uh, last question now, uh, thanks a lot for covering, uh, uh, a lot of details. Uh, just if you have to give like a brief answer that, uh, uh, for your product management plus research in qualitative and quantitative sides, uh, what, what, what are the features that are missing now, but you want AI to really, uh, give you those features that you can start using soon where you feel like you are often spending way more time or it's either it's an admin task or it's a data analysis or anything like your top priorities that you want Yeah. To, to solve? 

**Speaker 1 (455:16:55 \- 470:22:15):** Um, probably, probably where it would be most useful is, and again, thinking back to my previous job, you work on lots of different clients with lots of different industries and you don't know them all in depth. So you have to do what I was sort of talking about at the beginning in terms of the language that people are using, what they're talking about, what other brands they're using. Um, so sort of the desk research part of it. Um, creating a, like a, an information sheet or things that you might need to know about that brand, that industry, that sector, um, that would be very useful. Um, the data visualization side of things, I think those are the two most manual parts currently. Um, so those, I would guess would be the priorities. 

**Speaker 0 (470:47:35 \- 480:47:05):** Right. Okay. Great. Thanks. And, uh, about, uh, the collaboration point of view, uh, when you talk to people, uh, you take care of your team, uh, you have like seven, eight project, uh, going mm-Hmm. At the same time. And, uh, uh, in the project management for, from the project management point of view, do you see any direct application of AI there where you can save your time, uh, to easily convey your messes or, uh, you know, how help 

**Speaker 1 (481:10:25 \- 490:32:35):** Creating timelines and then like, timelines always change. So instead of having to go in and update manually, sort of when things will be ready or the new timeline, uh, being able to say, I've shifted this back X days and it updating, um, and managing the resource of people. So understanding, uh, on a given day, this person would have three different things to do where they can only do one. And sort of flagging that would be would, from a people point of view, that would be good. 

**Speaker 0 (491:08:35 \- 493:31:35):** And, and Right. Yeah, that's very interesting. And currently for project management, uh, can, could you please remind me, uh, what's the tool that you're using 

**Speaker 1 (493:52:35 \- 494:12:15):** For, for what aspects? Sorry? 

**Speaker 0 (494:19:55 \- 496:56:05):** Oh, for product management, how do you manage your product? What kind, how do you manage the progress of product? Like from the planning and then your, your team is working. 

**Speaker 1 (497:05:15 \- 497:26:45):** Yeah, there's no tool \<laugh\>, 

**Speaker 0 (497:28:15 \- 497:47:25):** There is no tool, no 

**Speaker 1 (497:52:45 \- 499:01:25):** \<laugh\>, no, it's just, it's just, it's just manual. Um, 

**Speaker 0 (499:13:15 \- 501:19:25):** Okay. So it's uh, like a lot of information that is scattered in people's personal space and then you have to ask them to provide you that. 

**Speaker 1 (501:28:35 \- 501:33:25):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (501:51:35 \- 507:18:05):** Right. And if there is a tool that can, uh, that, that, that can give you possibility to manage different stages of the project at a single place, would you be interested in the Yeah. Exploring that or that's like, uh, uh, too much information at same place and uh, you will still not use it? 

**Speaker 1 (507:35:45 \- 511:20:05):** Um, no. I mean, I think if it simplifies it and helps manage resource, I think is the main thing. Um, so understanding that and three weeks time this person has a big clash of projects, that would be, that would probably be the main thing. 

**Speaker 0 (511:38:05 \- 515:56:35):** Right. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Uh, is there anything else that you would like to highlight, uh, uh, in terms of, uh, increasing the use of AI in market research that I might not have ask before? Any other ideas discuss? 

**Speaker 1 (516:02:35 \- 521:49:55):** I don't think so. I think I've probably covered everything. I, I, I genuinely think for me and for others is it's sort of an, there's an awareness, knowledge gap, um, of what actually is available. Like some of these things probably are available. Um, so other than the things I think would be useful that I said that, that would be the main thing for me. 

**Speaker 0 (522:16:05 \- 524:40:55):** Right. Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah, that's very interesting. Uh, yeah, sometimes people just need to know that what's out there that can help them and Exactly. 

**Speaker 1 (524:45:25 \- 524:50:15):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (525:04:05 \- 525:42:15):** Yeah. Only then they can tell that, how it could be better. 

**Speaker 1 (525:52:05 \- 526:08:15):** Yeah, exactly. 

**Speaker 0 (526:28:05 \- 527:50:15):** Okay, great. Uh, thank you very much for your time, Jane, do you have any other question for me? 

**Speaker 1 (528:06:45 \- 528:11:35):** Nope. 

**Speaker 0 (528:23:15 \- 529:28:55):** No. Okay, great. Thanks again and have a nice, uh, rest of the day. 

**Speaker 1 (529:37:15 \- 529:50:15):** No worries. Thank you. 

**Speaker 0 (530:00:05 \- 530:08:15):** Bye-Bye 

**Speaker 1 (530:11:55 \- 530:15:35):** Bye.
