**Study invite**:  
Hello \_\_\_,  
\[Intro by Dave or Khadeeja\]:  
My name is Khadeeja and I’m a researcher with over 5 years of experience in mixed-methods and qualitative research. I am undertaking a project to assess the ways in which AI can aid the processes involved in qualitative research. This work is in collaboration with Beings.com \- a powerful AI-based platform centralising research tools such as interview recording, transcription, and assisted analysis. 

I am reaching out because of your expertise and experience in qualitative research methodologies. Over the next few weeks, I am aiming to interview about 10-12 experts to gauge the usefulness of the Beings.com platform and identify use cases for it. We intend to use the findings from this study to demonstrate the capabilities of Beings.com. As such, if you are willing to participate in the study, we would ask for your consent to use data from your interview in demo videos for the platform.

If you are interested in this study, please complete the brief pre-screening form linked here, after which you will be contacted by one of our team members. If you have questions you would like answered prior to agreeing to participate, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. 

I hope to hear back from you soon,  
Khadeeja Ahmed

**Questionnaire**:

2. Setting the stage  
1. What kind of project requirements do you think qualitative research methodologies fulfil? OR \- what considerations help you decide between quantitative and qualitative or mixed-methods research?  
2. What qualitative research methodologies do you find most useful in your work? (grounded theory, narrative analysis, etc.)  
3. Briefly, what are some of the challenges you face when doing qualitative research? (to capture any challenges that we may have missed in the questionnaire, or challenges that may be uncommon)  
3. Stages of qualitative research/workflow  
4. Please briefly delineate the processes or phases of qualitative research (sets focus on the distinct stages of qualitative research).  
5. Which phase of qualitative research do you find to be the most time-consuming, and why? (This could help identify how Beings.com could save time during qualitative research)  
6. What aspects of your current qualitative data analysis workflow do you find most tedious or inefficient? (workflow could include switching between Word and Excel for those who code without using specific tools; transcription; the process used for generating themes from codes, etc.)   
4. Tools used during qualitative research  
7. Which specific tools or software do you currently use for each stage of your qualitative research process (data collection, transcription, coding, analysis, reporting)? (This helps identify potential areas where Beings.com could replace or augment existing tools.)  
8. How valuable would it be to have a single platform that integrates recording, transcription, summarization, and analysis tools for qualitative research?  
5. Qualitative data analysis  
9. What are some strategies you employ to ensure accuracy and consistency within the various stages of qualitative research, such as transcription, coding, etc?
