Statistically representative sample 

Participants
	•	Statistically representative sample of the target audience Beings will address through B2B sales (large research agencies & large enterprises) and PLG sales (small research agencies and SME in-house)
	•	Define the segments 
	•	Large research agencies
	•	According to the Market Research Society (MRS), there are approximately 3,000 research agencies in the UK.
	•	The top tier (large agencies) is likely to be around 5-10% of the total, given the market concentration in a few large players.
	•	Estimated Population: 200 large research agencies
	•	Small research agencies 
	•	If we consider the remaining 90-95% of the research agencies (from the 3,000 total) as small, this would suggest:
	•	Estimated Population: 2,800 small research agencies.
	•	Large enterprises that conduct significant in-house research
	•	UK FTSE 100/250 businesses
	•	Estimated population: 350 businesses
	•	SMEs that conduct significant in-house research 
	•	There are about 5.5 million SMEs in the UK, but only a fraction will have dedicated in-house research teams.
	•	Focusing on mid-sized businesses (50-249 employees), which are more likely to have research capabilities, the ONS reports around 40,000 such businesses.
	•	However, not all will have dedicated research teams, so assume a fraction (e.g., 10-20%).
	•	Estimated Population: 6,000 SME in-house research teams.
	•	Total population estimate: 9,350 (100 + 250 + 200 + 2,800 + 6,000)
	•	Assuming a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error:
	•	Total Sample Size Required: Approximately 370 participants (using a sample size calculator based on a population of 9,350).
	•	Large research agencies 
	•	Proportion of Total Population: 200 / 9,350 ≈ 2.1%
	•	Sample Size: 2.1% of 370 ≈ 8 agencies
	•	Small research agencies
	•	Proportion of Total Population: 2,800 / 9,350 ≈ 29.9%
	•	Sample Size: 29.9% of 370 ≈ 111 agencies
	•	Large enterprise 
	•	FTSE 100
	•	Proportion of Total Population: 100 / 9,350 ≈ 1.1%
	•	Sample Size: 1.1% of 370 ≈ 4 businesses
	•	FTSE 250 = 10 
	•	Proportion of Total Population: 250 / 9,350 ≈ 2.7%
	•	Sample Size: 2.7% of 370 ≈ 10 businesses
	•	SME in-house teams 
	•	Proportion of Total Population: 6,000 / 9,350 ≈ 64.2%
	•	Sample Size: 64.2% of 370 ≈ 237 teams
