What makes us different? Well to put it simply, we not only design the change but also make it happen, turning strategy into action and action into results. We are not consultants but a team of industry experts with years of on-the-ground experience in a range of diverse fields. The result is we have the capability to solve problems in a way that some businesses just can’t, finding inspiration where others may find difficulty; especially when addressing tricky or seemingly hard to solve issues. Our work has addressed a diverse range of challenging issues both in the UK and internationally. We have reformed government judicial capabilities, transformed healthcare services, developed integrated strategies for organisations, improved communities and ultimately changed lives. We are extremely proud of our achievements. As a family-run business our values are based on collaboration, practical and realistic methods and making a difference. We are passionate about the issues our clients face, working with you and not just for you. Bringing energy and creative problem solving is fundamental to our approach as is an independent, down-to-earth pragmatism, ensuring solutions are implemented appropriately, on time and within budget. We also believe that solving tricky problems requires a consistency of approach. To ensure this happens you will always be working with the same team throughout the project until completion. We are proud to have been trusted to deliver over 400 contracts, developing and exporting British public service expertise.","Strategic planning, evaluation and review, organisational development, public sector organisational development, developing people, developing partnership working, management, market research and public consultation, Service Provision",1,1,"Professional Services, Healthcare, Public Services, Public Sector, Social Care",5,Not found,N/A,Multisector,"American Bar Society, British Council, Central Eastern Com NHS, Conexus, Crown Agents, DDC, Department for International Development, Department of Health, Derby City Council, DSD, East Lancashire Clinical Group, European, Foreign Commonwealth Office, Gloucestershire, Guys St Thomas NHS, Hall, HM Courts, HM Government Conflict, Hull Trains, Humberside Police, Individor, Lincolnshire, London, London Ambulance, London Deanery, PWC, Public Health England, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice, NHS England, NHS Hull, NHS United Lincolnshire Hospital, North Lincolnshire Council, Peterborough Council, Safecare Network, Sheffield Hallam University, South Yorkshire Police, USAID, Wigan Council, Youth Justice Board, YUCOM","Agencia Investigations, Health & Social Care, Justice, Policing & Security, ReWire Switching Off Painkiller Addiction, Tackling modern-day issues transformation, Tackling Serious Crime",FALSE,FALSE,"[{""keyword"": ""market research"", ""domain"": ""agencialtd.com"", ""snippet"": ""Agencia research the cost of economic inactivity for young people"", ""url"": ""https://agencialtd.com/connected-futures/""}, {""keyword"": ""strategic"", ""domain"": ""agencialtd.com"", ""snippet"": ""developed integrated strategies for organisations"", ""url"": ""http://www.agencialtd.com""}]","["""",""""]",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,UNSURE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
