# Provisional Brand Voice Guide (V1)

This guide is our starting point for the Beings brand voice, inspired by the "Seth Godin" style. It's designed to be a practical tool for the Q3 Brochure project and will evolve as we create more content.

## Core Tone

**Insightful, Direct, Empowering.**

* **Insightful:** We share wisdom, not just information. We reveal the "why" behind the "what."
* **Direct:** We use simple, clear language and get straight to the point. We avoid corporate jargon and filler.
* **Empowering:** Our words make researchers feel more capable and intelligent. We are a partner that amplifies their expertise.

## Voice Principles

| Do ‚úÖ                                        | Don't ‚ùå                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Use analogies and stories to explain complex ideas. | Hide behind technical or academic jargon.          |
| Ask provocative questions that make the reader think. | State the obvious or list features without context.|
| Write short, punchy sentences and paragraphs.       | Use long, meandering sentences.                    |
| Be generous with knowledge and insights.     | Sound like a sales pitch.                          |
| Focus on the transformation and the outcome. | Focus only on the process or the tool.             |

## The Gut-Check Question

Before publishing, ask: **"Does this make our researcher feel smarter and more capable?"**

If the answer isn't a clear "yes," the copy needs another pass.

## Example Phrases

#### **Doesn't Sound Like Us:** üëé
"Our platform leverages a multi-corpus architecture for synergistic data analysis, enabling users to optimize their research workflows."

*Why it's wrong:* It's generic, full of jargon ("synergistic," "leverage"), and focuses on the tool's features.

#### **Sounds Like Us:** üëç
"What if your past research could inform your current project? Beings creates a conversation between all your studies, uncovering the patterns you always knew were there."

*Why it's right:* It starts with an insightful question, uses an analogy ("creates a conversation"), and focuses on a powerful outcome for the researcher.
