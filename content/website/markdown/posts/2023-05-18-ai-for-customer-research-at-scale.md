## AI for Customer Research at Scale

## Customer Understanding in a Dynamic Market

Customers are more informed, connected, and discerning than ever, demanding personalised experiences that align with their evolving preferences. To meet these expectations and stay ahead of the curve, organisations must possess a deep and comprehensive understanding of their customers' motivations, attitudes, and behaviours.

## The Limitations of Traditional Customer Research Methods

While traditional customer research methods, such as surveys, focus groups, and interviews, have long been the cornerstone of understanding customer needs and behaviours, they often face significant limitations that hinder their effectiveness in today's dynamic and data-driven business environment.

Time-Consuming and Expensive Nature of Traditional Research: Traditional methods can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct. The process of designing, administering, and analysing these research projects can take weeks or even months, leading to delays in obtaining actionable insights. Additionally, the costs associated with recruiting participants, hiring moderators, and transcribing recordings can be substantial.

Difficulty in Capturing the Nuances and Complexities of Customer Behaviour: Traditional methods often struggle to capture the full range of customer behaviour, particularly in today's digital world where interactions with brands occur across multiple channels and leave a vast trail of digital footprints. These methods may miss subtle nuances, nonverbal cues, and emotional responses that can provide deeper insights into customer motivations and preferences.

Challenges in Scaling Traditional Methods to Handle Large-Scale Research: Traditional methods are often not scalable to handle large-scale research projects, especially when dealing with vast amounts of customer data from diverse sources. The manual nature of data collection, analysis, and interpretation becomes impractical as the volume of data increases, making it difficult to gain insights from large-scale customer datasets.

## The Unmet Need: Combining Depth and Breadth in Customer Research

The gap between the growing need for deep customer understanding and the limitations of traditional research methods has created an unmet demand for a research approach that combines depth and breadth. Organisations require a solution that not only provides rich, qualitative insights into customer motivations, attitudes, and behaviours but also has the scalability to handle large-scale data analysis and provide quantitative insights into customer trends and patterns.
