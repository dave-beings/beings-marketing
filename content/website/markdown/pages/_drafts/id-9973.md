## The Problems with Conducting Studies

### Time

#### “Collecting and processing data is time-consuming.”

Manually handling interviews, focus groups, and survey data can take up valuable time, slowing the research process and delaying insights.

**Manual data processing invites human error—missed deadlines, fragmented datasets, and vital insights slipping through the cracks.**

### Missed  
insights

#### “Important insights are often missed during analysis.”

Without the right tools, important data points and patterns may be overlooked, leading to incomplete or skewed results that don’t reflect the true findings.

##### **Missed insights lead to incomplete reports, weak conclusions, and the possibility of inaccurate recommendations that harm client relationships.**

### Data accuracy

#### “Ensuring data accuracy across multiple sources is tough.”

Managing consistency and accuracy across all sources can be challenging when gathering data from various interviews or focus groups, especially when dealing with large volumes of information.

##### Inaccurate or inconsistent data compromises the quality of your entire study, leading to flawed conclusions that diminish the value of your research.
