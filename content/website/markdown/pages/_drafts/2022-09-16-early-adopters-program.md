## Frequently asked questions

What is live streaming?

Live streaming, also known as ‘streaming’, is the act of broadcasting video or other media over the internet, in real time. The concept is similar to broadcasting live television.

What do businesses use live streaming for?

Live streaming is a great way for businesses to boost brand awareness and enhance employee engagement. It’s also used as a platform to connect with new audiences. Live streaming allows a business to meet customers or employees ‘where they are’ without needing to entice anyone to a physical event, for example. Live-streamed content can also be repurposed into marketing collateral, video on demand (VOD) content, or even edited into short snippets for use in social media posts.

What are the benefits of live streaming for a business?

When live streaming, the on-screen action happens in real time. A live broadcast means there is nowhere for the presenters or interviewees to hide. This immediacy helps to build a brand’s trust and credibility. Live video also allows an audience to get to know a business, presenter or employee. This enhances the relationship between the brand and the audience and boosts engagement with content.

## A word from the founder

**Dave Johnstone**

Founder of Beings

The power of video marketing is huge, and the with live streaming industry predicted to be worth $247 billion by 2027, it’s not slowing down.

But it’s not as simple as simply filming some video content and putting it online. Quality is key. Audiences are picky and won’t spend more than 90 seconds on a poor-quality live stream. 

That’s why we built Beings: to help marketers stand out from the crowd and live stream quality video, with confidence. 

We’ve worked with some of the world’s biggest brands to cast video globally. Now we need your input to build something that changes live streaming for marketers forever. 

Hope to see you on the EAP.
