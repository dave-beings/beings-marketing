## The Problems with Action

### Informing decisions

#### “Turning insights into action is easier said than done.”

Even with strong insights, knowing how to implement data-driven changes can be challenging.

**Without clear actions, research may have limited impact, reducing its value.**

### Actionable insights

#### “There’s a gap between analysis and real-world impact.”

Often, there’s a disconnect between the insights gained and practical, actionable steps.

**Without a structured framework, insights remain theoretical, failing to produce real results.**

### Delays

#### “Clients expect immediate action, but decisions take time.”

In many industries, delays in implementing insights can reduce their relevance and impact.

**Delays can lead to missed opportunities, impacting business outcomes and client satisfaction.**
