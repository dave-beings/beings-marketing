## The Problems with Conducting Studies

### Time to insight

#### “Collecting and processing data is time-consuming.”

In-person research can limit scale and consistency, while remote methods often miss deeper, contextual details. Manually handling interviews, focus groups, and survey data adds further delays, introducing human error and risking vital insights being overlooked.

**It can be a struggle to streamline data collection and processing, thus ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and faster delivery of valuable findings.**

### Missed  
insights

#### “Important insights are often missed during analysis.”

Without the right tools, important data points and patterns may be overlooked, leading to incomplete or skewed results that don’t reflect the true findings.

##### **Missed insights lead to incomplete reports, weak conclusions, and the possibility of inaccurate recommendations that harm client relationships.**

### Stakeholder buy-in

#### "We need stakeholders involved, but not disruptions.”

Managing consistency and accuracy becomes difficult when multiple stakeholders observe sessions, often disrupting the flow and creating fragmented data.

**Without balanced stakeholder involvement, sessions lose focus, participants feel pressured, and insights become fragmented as too many voices risk spoiling the outcome.**
