> With Aida’s help during the study phase, every piece of qualitative data has been meticulously gathered and organised. Now, Aida takes that data to the next level, turning it into insights that can drive your strategy forward.

## The Challenges of Extracting Insights

### Large  
datasets

#### “Sorting through data for insights feels overwhelming.”

Large datasets can be daunting, and finding the right patterns or themes can feel impossible.

**Without the right tools, essential insights can be missed, leading to incomplete or skewed conclusions.**

### Actionable  
insights

#### “Turning raw data into actionable insights is challenging.”

Raw data doesn’t offer immediate value—it’s only when it’s converted into insights that it can drive real decisions. But the process can be slow and complex.

**Failing to extract actionable insights can cause your research to miss the mark, providing little to no value for you or clients.**

### Analysis  
takes time

#### “Stakeholders expect results quickly, but data analysis takes time.”

The need for rapid insight delivery can put pressure on researchers, leading to delays in analysis and missed opportunities for timely decision-making.

**Slow delivery of insights can strain client relationships and cause you to miss key decision-making windows.**
