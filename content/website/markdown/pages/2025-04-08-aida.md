#### Who has access to my recordings?

All recordings created with Beings are 100% private. They can only be seen if you share your recordings or highlights with others.

#### Is my data secure?

**Yes — Beings is built with security at its core.**  
We follow industry best practices, including end-to-end encryption, continuous monitoring, and regular third-party penetration testing. Beings is ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA certified and has passed a comprehensive security review by Google, Microsoft and Zoom as part of our partnerships.  
You can find full security details at [trust.beings.com](https://trust.beings.com).

#### Does Beings train its AI on our data?

No. Beings never uses your data to train or improve its AI models. Your recordings, transcripts, notes, files and chats are completely private and used only to deliver your experience. We don’t use your data to train third-party models either. Your research stays yours — always.

#### Should I be concerned about my privacy?

**We take your privacy seriously.**  
That’s why we’ve removed all third-party cookies and worked with our legal team to write terms and policies you can actually understand — no law degree required.

#### Worried about recordings?

You’re not alone — but most people aren’t worried.  
If you haven’t recorded calls before, it’s normal to feel uncertain. But in our experience, people are far less concerned than you might think. In fact, in roles like Customer Success, over 90% of calls are already recorded — with rare exceptions for sensitive legal or enterprise conversations.

Surprisingly, more than half of participants actually prefer having access to the recording. They appreciate being able to revisit key points, especially when it’s shared for their benefit. And with Beings, you can share the full recording without exposing your personal notes or highlights.

If someone ever feels uncomfortable, you can pause the recording at any time — you’re always in control.
