###### Secure by default

## üîí Data Security: Built In, Not Bolted On

In a world where data breaches make headlines, secure research infrastructure is no longer optional ‚Äî it's essential.

Beings is committed to **end-to-end data security**, aligning with the core principles of Trusted Research Environments:

- Zero PII leakage: Personally identifiable information is never exposed to downstream processes.
- Encryption everywhere: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, following enterprise-grade standards.
- Access control: Only verified, authorised users can access session content, recordings, or data.
- Audit-ready: Every session, action, and data interaction is logged for compliance, review, and transparency.
- Jurisdiction-aware: Our infrastructure supports GDPR, HIPAA, and global regulatory frameworks.

> ‚úÖ Data isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúused‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs protected, governed, and treated with the respect it deserves.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Your questions answered, so you can choose your plan with confidence.

What counts as an "hour of upload / recording"?

One hour of credit is equivalent to one hour of audio or video file that you upload for transcription and analysis.

What happens when my 14-day trial ends?

At the end of your trial, you will be asked to choose a plan and enter your payment details to continue using the paid features. If you choose not to, your account will be automatically moved to the Free plan. You won‚Äôt lose your work on your first 3 projects.

Are you GDPR compliant?

Yes. We are fully compliant with GDPR. All data is processed and stored on servers located within the EU, and we are committed to upholding the highest standards of data privacy and protection for all our users.

Can I change my plan later?

Absolutely. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time from your account settings. Upgrades are pro-rated, and downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing cycle.

Do you offer discounts for students or non-profits?

Yes! We are committed to supporting the next generation of researchers and organisations doing important work. Please contact our support team with proof of your academic or non-profit status for a special discount.

What kind of support is included?

All users have access to our comprehensive help centre and email support. Team plan users get priority email and live chat support. Business plan users receive a dedicated account manager, a Service Level Agreement (SLA), and personalised onboarding for their team.
