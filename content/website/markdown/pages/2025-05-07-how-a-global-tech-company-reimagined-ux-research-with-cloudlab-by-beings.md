##### THE CHALLENGE

## $100M Labs, 11.8% Utilization

Between 2015 and 2022, one of the world’s leading tech companies invested over $100M building sophisticated UX research labs: robotic cameras, mirrored observation galleries, high-end AV infrastructure. But by 2023, post-COVID usage had dropped to just **11.8%**.

Researchers were:

- Tied to physical locations, limiting participant diversity
- Dependent on complex, inflexible AV setups
- Using third-party tools in non-compliant ways
- Struggling with inconsistent workflows and 40+ disconnected tools

As the new Global Head of UX put it:

“How do we escape the labs?”

That single question sparked a transformation.

##### THE OPPORTUNITY

## Software-Defined Research

A senior program manager on the UX Infrastructure team discovered Beings through a demo of the 'Infinite Control Room.' Originally designed for livestreaming and content capture, Beings' platform offered a configurable foundation for something much bigger: **a co-intelligence research operating system.**

Other vendors offered generic solutions. Beings embraced true partnership.

This wasn't about replacing researchers with AI—it was about amplifying their expertise. Together, we co-created **CloudLab**: a secure, cloud-native platform that pairs expert researchers with intelligent systems to conduct, observe, and analyze UX research anywhere—from labs to living rooms to live urban walk-throughs.

##### THE DEPLOYMENT

## From Wearables to Streaming

Over five rapid sprints, Beings partnered with researchers and program managers from:

- Streaming media
- Wearable devices
- Search
- Ads
- Phones
- Mobility, navigation and automotive platforms
- Health and smart home initiatives

Teams simulated:

- Multi-angle living room tests for smart TVs
- Over-the-shoulder mobile walkthroughs
- Wrist-mounted smartwatch navigation

Beings didn’t just provide software—we co-designed camera kits, built training flows, and helped align security reviews across internal teams.

###### What Researchers Loved

## Google’s researchers put CloudLab through its paces—and were impressed. Whether in-lab, remote, or on the move, they found a system that flexed to their workflows, respected their privacy, and let them focus on what matters: the research.

###### Custom Layouts

## 🎛️ Total Layout Control

CloudLab's drag-and-drop canvas let researchers design video layouts in seconds, toggle views with keyboard shortcuts, and run sessions without AV support.

- Add webcams, media, and overlays however you like
- Build and toggle between your favorite layouts (we call them “scenes”)
- Use drag-and-drop or keyboard shortcuts to edit on the fly
- Brand your session, add instructions, or just set the mood with a color gradient

> “Super intuitive. I can just drop in what I need and switch layouts live.”

###### Multiple cameras

## 📱 Mobile + Field Study Support

With Beings' mobile app, researchers used phones and tablets as screen shares, context cameras, and gesture cams.

- Scan a QR code to turn your phone into a second (or third) camera
- Use the back camera for gestures, product tests, or contextual views
- Share your mobile screen directly into the session
- Layer everything together — no extra tech needed

> “Capturing both the participant’s face and their phone screen at once? Game-changing.”

###### Data security

## 🔒 Stakeholder Privacy + Recording Control

Full ownership stayed with the researcher. Recordings only occurred with explicit permissions. Sessions synced to internal cloud storage systems.

- Zero PII leakage: Personally identifiable information is never exposed to downstream processes.
- Encryption everywhere: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, following enterprise-grade standards.
- Access control: Only verified, authorised users can access session content, recordings, or data.
- Audit-ready: Every session, action, and data interaction is logged for compliance, review, and transparency.
- Jurisdiction-aware: Our infrastructure supports GDPR, HIPAA, and global regulatory frameworks.

🔐 Enterprise-grade privacy and compliance, built in.

##### Our certifications

> ✅ Data isn’t just “used” — it’s protected, governed, and treated with the respect it deserves.

##### THE RESULTS

## $28M Saved + Researcher Autonomy

CloudLab replaced fixed infrastructure with a secure, scalable research layer that:

- Enabled mobile-first, hybrid, and in-home research
- Supported up to **8 live feeds** with researcher-controlled layouts
- Integrated directly with internal cloud and compliance systems
- Reduced dependence on AV vendors and local IT
- Aligned with enterprise-grade compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001)

#### **💰 Cost + Efficiency**

- **$28M projected savings** by decommissioning legacy labs
- **13,500+ sq ft** of real estate reclaimed
- Fewer handoffs and tools across workflows

#### **🙋‍♂️ Researcher Experience**

- More autonomy, faster setup, and simplified logistics
- Greater access to diverse, real-world participants

#### **🏆 Strategic Recognition**
