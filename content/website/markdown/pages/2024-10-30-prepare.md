## Common Issues in Research Preparation

See how teams like yours have smashed their research goals

### Speed

#### "We're constantly under pressure to deliver insights quickly."

##### Tight deadlines and stakeholder expectations make it difficult to deliver high-quality insights without the risk of misalignment.

**Projects can easily go off course when objectives are unclear from the start.**

### Multiple projects

#### “Managing multiple projects at once is overwhelming.”

With a small team and multiple research projects running at once, staying organised can feel impossible. Plans overlap, deadlines slip, and incomplete research risks damaging your reputation and client trust.  

**Without a clear system or tool to help, the chaos grows – costing you time, focus, and results.  
**

### Bias

#### “Ensuring unbiased research design is tough.”

##### It is critical to avoid bias in the early stages of research planning. However, without the right tools, it’s easy to unintentionally skew results, leading to insights that may not fully reflect the truth.

**Introducing bias at the planning stage compromises the integrity of your entire study, leading to skewed data that weakens your findings.**

### Scope creep

#### "Keeping track of stakeholder requirements is challenging.”

##### Gathering, organising, and managing the varying needs of stakeholders during the planning phase can be difficult. If any requirements are miscommunicated, the research output may not meet client expectations.

**Misunderstood requirements result in wasted effort, producing insights that fail to deliver actionable outcomes, which may lead to losing clients or projects.**
