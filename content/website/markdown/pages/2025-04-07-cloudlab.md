###### CloudLab

# Built for Depth. Designed for Researchers.

##### You don’t need to be an early adopter. You just need tools that work the way you do — thoughtful, adaptable, and quietly powerful.

###### Research lab

## Whether you're running in-depth interviews, usability studies, or collaborative workshops, Cloudlab gives you the flexibility to shape your sessions, your way — without giving up control, clarity, or craft.

## What you'll see in this walkthrough

- How to build and run a session in minutes — not hours
- How to design your video layout like a live, editable canvas
- How to bring in phone cameras, media assets, and multiple participants
- What happens when recording, automation, and creativity all sit in the same space

👀 _Spoiler: You get more done, and it still feels like real research._

###### Set up in seconds

## ✳️ Start Simple. Stay in Control.

- Launch a new session from your dashboard
- Invite participants, teammates, or observers by email or link
- Add multiple video sources (including phone cameras) for richer context
- Everything previews before you record, so nothing is left to chance

###### Custom Layouts

## Make the Canvas Yours

Design your research space like you’d set up a physical room — but better.

- Add webcams, media, and overlays however you like
- Build and toggle between your favorite layouts (we call them “scenes”)
- Use drag-and-drop or keyboard shortcuts to edit on the fly
- Brand your session, add instructions, or just set the mood with a color gradient

###### Multiple cameras

## 📱 Go Multisource. Go Mobile.

Sometimes, one camera just isn’t enough.

- Scan a QR code to turn your phone into a second (or third) camera
- Use the back camera for gestures, product tests, or contextual views
- Share your mobile screen directly into the session
- Layer everything together — no extra tech needed

###### Recording

## 🔴 Record Without the Hassle

- Start and stop recordings in one click
- Files are auto-saved to your media library (and Google Drive, if you like)
- Receive email notifications when everything’s ready
- Share insights directly from your Beings repository

🔐 Enterprise-grade privacy and compliance, built in.

> 💾 No downloads. No file chaos. Just everything where it should be.

###### Observer mode

## 🤝 Collaboration Without the Chaos

You don’t need to onboard the whole org to run a good session.

- Stream sessions live to Google Meet for passive observers (Teams + Zoom coming soon)
- Toggle between host, participant, and observer roles in real time
- Choose light mode or dark mode — whatever works for you
- Fully private, secure, and ethically built from the ground up

###### Secure by default

## 🔒 Data Security: Built In, Not Bolted On

In a world where data breaches make headlines, secure research infrastructure is no longer optional — it's essential.

Beings is committed to **end-to-end data security**, aligning with the core principles of Trusted Research Environments:

- Zero PII leakage: Personally identifiable information is never exposed to downstream processes.
- Encryption everywhere: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, following enterprise-grade standards.
- Access control: Only verified, authorised users can access session content, recordings, or data.
- Audit-ready: Every session, action, and data interaction is logged for compliance, review, and transparency.
- Jurisdiction-aware: Our infrastructure supports GDPR, HIPAA, and global regulatory frameworks.

> ✅ Data isn’t just “used” — it’s protected, governed, and treated with the respect it deserves.
