## Recruiting for Research Can Be Challenging

See how teams like yours have smashed their research goals

### Slow

#### “Finding the right participants takes too long.”

Recruitment is often the slowest part of the research process. Identifying participants who meet your criteria can take far too much time, delaying the start of your study and frustrating your stakeholders.

##### Delays in recruitment disrupt your project timeline, potentially causing client dissatisfaction and affecting the credibility of your research.

### Disrupted

#### “No-shows and last-minute cancellations disrupt research timelines.”

Recruiting the wrong participants—or those who aren’t fully engaged—leads to frequent cancellations, no-shows, or dropouts.

**These interruptions force researchers to reschedule, costing both time and money and creating chaos in your research schedule.**

### Consent

#### “Managing participant engagement and consent is time-consuming.”

Tracking consent forms, sending out reminders, and managing schedules by hand can easily overwhelm research teams, especially when working with larger groups of participants.

##### Without efficient consent management, there’s a risk of non-compliance with data protection laws, compromising participant privacy and opening the door to legal repercussions.

### Quality

#### “It’s difficult to balance speed and quality in recruitment.”

Rushing recruitment to meet deadlines can mean lower-quality participants who don’t align with research goals. On the other hand, taking extra time for ideal matches can slow down the study, creating a challenging trade-off between speed and quality.

##### Without a balanced approach, the recruitment process risks either compromising on data quality or extending timelines beyond stakeholder expectations.
