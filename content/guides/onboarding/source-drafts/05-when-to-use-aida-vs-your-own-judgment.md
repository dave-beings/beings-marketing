# **When to Use Aida vs. Your Own Judgment**

Let’s be clear: **Aida is not here to replace your judgment.** 

But you can get the best out of your research analysis when you know when to lean on Aida and when to trust your own expertise.

This article looks at that balance. 

# **Where Aida Adds the Most Value**

Since Aida handles the messy parts of qualitative research that normally take hours, its strength lies in speed, consistency, and structure. 

**1\. Speed**  
Analyzing 20 transcripts and asking for a summary can mean days of reading, coding, and re-coding. Aida can deliver a clear overview in minutes. You’ll still need to interpret what it means, but **you don’t have to spend half a week preparing the raw material.**

Let’s imagine, for example, that you’ve just finished a round of customer interviews about a new app. Instead of manually reviewing 100 pages of transcripts, you ask Aida to summarise each session and get a concise list of recurring themes (e.g., ease of use, security concerns, pricing). 

**You’re now free to spend your time thinking about why those issues matter.**

**2\. Consistency**  
Human analysis can be biased, so two researchers coding the same transcript might cluster comments differently. 

Aida, on the other hand, acts as **an impartial assistant** that applies the same logic across the dataset and gives you a baseline of consistent categories.

What does this mean in practice? 

Say that some of the customers you interviewed mentioned a total of seven types of issues with your product or service. 

Aida lets you start with a neutral structure by grouping these into themes **without letting your own expectations skew the process,** so that lyou and your team can then decide which theme needs to be addressed and how.

**3\. Exploration**  
Aida can easily surface patterns you might not spot on your own. **It can spark new angles** that you may or may not consider while drawing your post-research action plan.

For example, while analysing feedback on an e-commerce checkout, you focus on pricing complaints because this is what most participants mentioned.

But after asking Aida to analyse the transcripts, you discover that some participants think the confirmation page looks confusing—a detail that in a sea of data might have slipped past you. 

Aida wouldn’t allow that to happen.

**Where Your Judgment is Essential**

If Aida is good at speed, consistency, and exploration, you are essential for interpretation and context. 

When is it best to lean on your own judgment instead of taking Aida’s output at face value?

## **1\. When Interpreting Nuance**

Aida might flag that participants complained about “too many buttons” when testing the beta version of your app.  

On paper, that looks like a usability flaw, but from sitting in the sessions, you noticed that the frustration came mostly at the very start and then eased once participants became familiar with the flow. 

Your judgment tells you this is more of a *learning curve* than a design failure. Trust that, so you can reassure stakeholders that it’s an adjustment issue, not a flaw in the product.

## **2\. When Deciding Priorities**

Aida gives you recommendations based on data analysis, but **you’re the only one who knows which ones are *strategically* more important than others.**

For example, let’s imagine that 10 people complained about the colour scheme of your app, and only 2 people raised concerns about privacy and security. Aida might prioritise addressing design preferences, but in your context, you know that security concerns carry much more weight—even if they came up less often.

This is where your judgment matters most: **deciding which issues are critical to address, which can wait, and which might not need action at all.** 

Aida points you to the patterns. 

You choose what truly deserves attention.

## **3\. When Feedback Conflicts with Past Experience**

Aida might tell you that participants complained about “confusing icons” when beta-testing your new platform. Is this a serious barrier that will prevent your customers from having a great user experience?

Maybe not. 

In fact, you may have seen similar feedback in a previous round of testing, where participants initially resisted a feature but quickly adapted once they used it more. 

Drawing on that experience, you know this isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker since you know it reflects initial unfamiliarity rather than a true flaw.

The point is: **You know your context better than Aida does**, and you should definitely trust that knowledge to make final decisions.

# **Top Tip: Work in Partnership**

The best results come when you use Aida and your expertise together, like partners.

You can think of it as a division of labour:

* Aida handles **messy data → structure**.  
* You provide **structure → meaning**.

Example workflow:

1. Aida summarises 15 transcripts.

2. **You refine prompts** to cluster ideas more clearly.

3. Aida tags quotes to themes.

4. **You decide which insights matter most** for the business problem.

5. Aida drafts recommendations.

6. **You adapt them to align with strategy** and stakeholder needs.

Aida structures the raw material, but you can step in whenever the output bumps against context, strategy, or nuance. That’s the moment to use your judgment.

This will help you get faster, clearer, and more credible results than working alone.
