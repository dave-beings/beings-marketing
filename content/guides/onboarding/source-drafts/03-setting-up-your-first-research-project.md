# **Setting Up Your First Research Project in Beings**

It’s easy to create your first project in **Beings.** 

This guide will show you all the steps you need to take, so you can quickly generate insights you can use in your research.

Let’s begin.

# **Step 1: Create Your Account and Log In**

Go to [app.beings.com](https://app.beings.com/) and sign up for a free account. The process is quick, and you’ll be taken straight to your dashboard once you’ve confirmed your email.

# **Step 2: Start a New Project**

1. From the dashboard, open the left sidebar by clicking the three lines in the top-left corner.   
2. Click the **\+** next to **Projects** to create a new project.  
3. Give your project a clear, descriptive name — something like *Onboarding Interviews – June 2025* works better than simply *Interviews.* A clear project name helps you keep track of different studies and makes it easier for colleagues to understand what the project contains without opening it.

# **Step 3: Add Your Data**

You can add data in two ways:

* Upload files directly from your computer  
* Let Aida record a live meeting on Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet.

**Upload files directly**

1. In the chat panel, hover over the blue **\+** button at the bottom-left.  
2. Select **Upload file**.  
3. Drop the file or choose it from your computer.  
4. Once uploaded, the file will appear in your project, ready for analysis.

**Let Aida record a live meeting**

1. Hover over same blue \+ button and select **Start recording**.  
2. In the pop-up window, paste the link to your Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams session.  
3. When the meeting begins, Aida will request to join as [*aida@beings.com*](mailto:aida@beings.com) (make sure the host admits Aida).  
4. Aida records the session and automatically creates a transcript when the meeting ends. You’ll see the file in the left sidebar.

Now that you have your data, you can use prompts to analyse the transcript, extract themes, and build summaries for stakeholders. 

This means no manual transcription, faster turnaround, and a more reliable record of conversations.

 

# **Step 4: Craft Your First Prompt**

1. From the left sidebar, select a file you want Aida to work on.   
2. The three quick commands in the chat panel — **Summarise, Discuss, Evaluate** — will now be active. You can click on one of these to start the analysis or you can write your own prompt. Try both.   
3. Type your prompt and press enter. Within seconds, Aida will produce an output that would normally take hours of manual coding.  
4. If you want to go further, refine your prompt, for example: *Group these five themes into three broader categories.*

Tip: A good first prompt is short, specific, and clear. For example: *Identify five main themes from this interview. For each theme, include a supporting quote.*

# **Step 5: Review and Explore Outputs**

Aida’s outputs are designed to be easy to read and act on. They’re written in plain, professional language and often include **small blue numbers** in the text. These act like footnotes which links directly back to the transcript. Hover over them to see exactly where Aida found that piece of information.

For researchers, this means that:

* You can trace insights back to the source and verify accuracy.  
* Evidence is always at hand when presenting findings.  
* It’s simple to pull verbatim quotes for reports.

These references also show that the analysis isn’t a “black box.” Every claim is backed up with traceable data.

But what if you’re not satisfied with an output? No problem. Simply refine your instructions and re-run the analysis.

# **Step 6: Export and Share Results**

Once you’re happy with the output, you can save or share it in three ways. 

Look for the three icons below each response:

1. **Convert to source**: This creates a new file in your project that you can download, rename, and analyse.  
2. **Convert to note**: Saves the output as a note, which will appear in the **Notes panel** on the right sidebar.  
3. **Copy text**: Copies the output so you can paste it directly into your report, presentation, document, or wherever you need it.

As you can see, you can keep outputs neatly organised inside Beings or move them quickly into your existing workflows.

# **A quick scenario…**

Imagine you’ve just completed a set of consumer interviews for a new product concept. You upload the first transcript to Beings and run the prompt:

*Identify the top five needs or frustrations mentioned by participants. Include supporting quotes.*

In less than a minute, Aida generates a clear list of customer insights, each backed with verbatim evidence. You then refine the output to create a one-page stakeholder summary with recommendations on product positioning.

That summary goes straight to your client or manager, who can immediately see what customers value most — and has the evidence to shape the next phase of research or product development.

# **First Project: Done\!** 

You’ve just set up your first research project in Beings. With only a transcript and a simple prompt, you’ve produced a structured, shareable insight in minutes.

Each new project will feel quicker and easier, so you’ll spend less time on admin and more time on meaningful, detailed analysis, which can lead to faster results, stronger evidence, and better decisions.

The next step is to experiment with more prompts and upload multiple files.
