# **Manager’s Guide to Onboarding Researchers in Beings**

Introducing Beings to your team is always a balancing act. Researchers already know your methods, clients, and deliverables, but adopting a new platform can feel disruptive. This guide provides a practical roadmap for rolling out Beings smoothly, with a checklist, first-month milestones, and best practices to build confidence and get started on the right foot.

## **Why Manager Involvement Matters**

It’s tempting to assume researchers will “just figure it out” once they log in. But teams that leave onboarding to chance risk three things:

1. **Slow adoption**. New hires naturally fall back on old, manual habits unless guided otherwise.  
2. **Missed value**. Beings will be underused, reducing its value.  
3. **Confidence gaps**. Researchers hesitate to share outputs if they’re unsure of quality.

Your role as a manager is to set the tone. Frame Aida as a research partner and your researchers will come round to the idea of experimenting. 

## **Pre-Onboarding Checklist**

Before rolling Beings out to the team, set everyone up for success by ensuring these points are followed:

* **Accounts ready:** Confirm logins, project access, and permissions in advance.  
* **Example projects loaded:** Upload a few transcripts so the dashboard isn’t empty.  
* **First practice project chosen:** Pick a low-stakes dataset (e.g. an internal pilot or past project) to reduce pressure when people are trying things out.  
* **Expectations clarified:** Share how Beings outputs are intended to be used so researchers know what to aim for.

These small steps make the first login less intimidating and give the team a sense of context.

## **Week 1 Milestones: Building Familiarity**

The first week of rollout should be all about building confidence. Aim for a light introduction by walking the team through the dashboard, pointing out the features they’ll use most often, and agreeing on a first exercise such as running a transcript through Aida with a few simple prompts so they can get a feel for the different kinds of outputs.

Once the outputs are ready, review them together as a group. Use this to highlight where Aida performs well and where your researchers can step in and adjust things. Towards the end of the week, introduce the Prompt Library and let team members experiment with a few pre-set prompts. By the end of Week 1, your researchers should feel comfortable navigating Beings on their own, and confident in producing a basic summary. 

## **Weeks 2–4: From Basics to Real Value**

Once your team has the basics under their belt, start stretching their use of Beings towards deeper analysis and synthesis. In the second week, focus on coding: show how to use Aida’s coding suggestions to tag multiple transcripts, then practise clustering insights across participants. Encourage researchers to share their early reflections in a team review so everyone sees how outputs compare with expectations.

By the third week, the aim is to create more structured outputs. A good milestone is producing a short research guide or working debrief for internal use. This is also the moment to introduce more advanced prompts, such as asking Aida to compare motivations across groups. Team members can begin building their own prompt libraries, gradually creating reusable assets that benefit everyone.

In the fourth week, shift towards client-facing quality. Have the team prepare a mini output, like a debrief, and review it together before sharing externally. At this point, they should feel comfortable handling multiple transcripts within a project and be able to bring Aida-powered insights directly into team discussions. By the end of the first month, most researchers will be working competently in Beings. They should be able to upload the necessary material, prompt Aida well, and deliver solid outputs that are ready to share.

## **Best Practices for Managers**

There are a few habits you can adopt to make team onboarding smoother and more motivating:

* **Assign a Beings buddy:** Pair less confident users with early adopters who can answer quick questions.  
* **Check in weekly:** Short progress reviews maintain alignment.  
* **Celebrate quick wins:** Share Aida-generated success with your team.  
* **Encourage personal prompt libraries:** Advise team members to save prompts that worked well.  
* **Reinforce the mindset:** Remind your team that Aida is like a super-fast assistant. 

## **Avoid Common Onboarding Pitfalls**

Even experienced managers fall into common traps. For example, Beings is built to analyse and synthesise a lot of data, not just transcribe. Similarly, don’t expect your team to be instant masters. There’s always a learning curve involved with new tools: embrace it. Introduce Aida bit by bit to avoid information overload, and make sure you set up shared reviews to get everyone on the same page regarding expectations.

If you avoid these pitfalls, adoption will feel smoother for everyone.

## **Measuring Successful Onboarding**

You’ll know the rollout is working when you start to see researchers using Beings on their own. Team members will begin logging in regularly, producing their own summaries, guides, or debriefs without needing you to nudge them. As adoption grows, you’ll notice a reduction in the time spent on manual analysis, freeing people to focus more on higher-level synthesis and storytelling. Most importantly, researchers will share Aida outputs proactively in team discussions or client settings, showing both confidence and trust in the platform.

It never hurts to check in directly. Ask your team about the good, the bad, and the ugly. By listening to your researchers’ feedback, you can improve their experience and help solve any issues early.

## **Quick Reference: The Onboarding Checklist**

**Pre-Onboarding**

* Set up accounts and permissions  
* Load example projects  
* Choose a practice project  
* Share organisational expectations

**Week 1 Goals**

* Orientation and dashboard walkthrough  
* First transcript summary with Aida  
* Group review of outputs  
* Experiment with the Prompt Library

**Weeks 2–4 Goals**

* Use coding suggestions and clustering  
* Produce internal research guide  
* Save effective prompts  
* Deliver a mini client-ready output

**Best Practices**

* Buddy system  
* Weekly check-ins  
* Celebrate milestones  
* Reinforce Beings as a thinking partner

## **From Rollout to Routine**

Rolling out Beings to an established team doesn’t have to be disruptive. All it takes is a little preparation and some clear goals. In the end, a better onboarding process will result in stronger and more reliable insights. Not only that, but when researchers use Aida frequently, they free up time to focus on higher-value analysis and deliver insights to clients faster.
