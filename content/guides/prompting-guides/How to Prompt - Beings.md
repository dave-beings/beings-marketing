<a id="_i81q3mpmnvb3"></a>A Guide to Working with Your AI Research Partner

# <a id="_3n5409ny976y"></a>Introduction

This guide introduces the most important skill for using Beings effectively: how to collaborate with your AI research partner, Aida, to produce faster and deeper work\. 

Aida is designed to be your co\-pilot for qualitative analysis—helping you surface themes, validate hypotheses, and accelerate your workflow without sacrificing analytical rigour\.

But just like a human teammate, she needs clear direction\. A great prompt unlocks great insight\.

# <a id="_12i5uhauvmf5"></a>🤝 Think of Aida as Your Research Partner

Aida is like a brilliant junior researcher: fast, methodical, and deeply trained in qualitative methods\. But she lacks your specific context and strategic intent\.

Your prompt is her brief\.

A well\-structured prompt delivers targeted, meaningful insights in seconds\. A vague one? Not so much\.

# <a id="_vtuupwfuzcl8"></a>🧠 The 4 C’s of Strategic Prompting

Use the 4 C’s framework to consistently get high\-quality, usable outputs\.  
 Each example below is based on analysing an interview with a long\-term healthcare plan member\.

## <a id="_9osoe2howezx"></a>1\. Context – Set the Scene

Tell Aida what she’s looking at, and what your goal is\.

- 💬 Instead of: 
	- “Summarise this\.”
-  ✅ Try: 
	- “This is an interview transcript with a long\-term member of the company Health plan\. Our goal is to understand the drivers of their loyalty and any frustrations with the service\.”

## <a id="_d8kcel4sa9k1"></a>2\. Clarity – Be Specific

Define the task clearly\. Vague inputs lead to vague outputs\.

- 💬 Instead of: 
	- “Find the main themes\.”
-  ✅ Try: 
	- “List the top five frustrations mentioned in this transcript related to service process\. Focus specifically on bureaucracy, communication, and approvals\.”

## <a id="_7tao1mm49grk"></a>3\. Constraint – Guide the Output

Tell Aida how to format the response so it’s immediately usable\.

- 💬 Instead of: 
	- “What are the key points?”
-  ✅ Try: 
	- “Extract three direct quotes about ‘brand loyalty vs\. Bupa\.’ Present them in a two\-column table with headers: ‘Quote’ and ‘Participant ID\.’”

## <a id="_ha9gfnojn6d2"></a>4\. Converse – Keep the Dialogue Going

Aida works best in conversation\. Ask follow\-ups to dig deeper\.

- 💬 Initial Prompt: 
	- “What process frustrations are mentioned in this transcript?”
- 💬 Follow\-up: 
	- “That’s a key finding\. Can you expand on the point about needing pre\-approval for an on\-the\-spot procedure? What was the root cause of that frustration, according to the participant?”

Here are a few ways to put the 4 C’s into action across common research tasks:

## <a id="_jerzrj8wmcfh"></a>🧩 To Extract Themes Across Interviews

Prompt:

- "\[Context\] I’m analysing 28 interview transcripts with healthcare plan members\.  
 \[Clarity\] Identify the top 5 recurring ‘pain points’ and ‘moments of delight\.’  
 \[Constraint\] For each, include three anonymised quotes as supporting evidence\."

## <a id="_8ixljy1n2uog"></a>📝 To Pressure\-Test a Discussion Guide

Prompt:

- "\[Context\] Act as a research methodologist reviewing a discussion guide\.  
 \[Clarity\] Identify any questions that are leading or contain jargon\.  
 \[Constraint\] For each issue, explain the problem and suggest a more neutral rewrite\."

# <a id="_pk3axykyq8hu"></a>🚀 Your Co\-Pilot for Deeper Insight

With the right prompt, Aida can help you:

-  Code interviews
-  Surface themes
-  Extract messaging
-  Refine discussion guides
-  Pressure\-test hypotheses
-  Save hours of manual synthesis

__Prompt well\. Think clearly\. Dig deeper\.  
__That’s how you unlock the full power of Beings\.
