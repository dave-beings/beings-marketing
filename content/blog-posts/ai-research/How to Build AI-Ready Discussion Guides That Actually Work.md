<a id="_shn58y8rchxy"></a>How to Build AI\-Ready Discussion Guides That Actually Work

If you’re using AI to help with research, the quality of your discussion guide matters\. A loose guide leads to vague conversations\. Vague conversations lead to useless summaries\. The AI can’t fix that\. It can only reflect what you give it\.

This guide is about writing with purpose\. Not to control the conversation, but to give it shape\. You’ll learn how to define what you’re trying to find out, ask questions that lead somewhere, and structure your guide so it holds up in analysis\.

Keep it clear\. Keep it focused\. The rest gets easier\.

## <a id="_ab3i86psxxfb"></a>__How to Build AI\-Ready Discussion Guides at a Glance__

- __Set a clear purpose\.__ Define what the research is meant to inform\. Vague goals lead to vague guides and even vaguer outputs\.  

- __Write for what happens next\.__ Shape your questions around the decisions, messages, or behaviours you're trying to understand — not just themes\.  

- __Be specific\.__ Open questions are useful, but prompts like “Tell me about your experience” don’t lead anywhere\. Ask what didn’t work, what surprised them, or what they expected\.  

- __Structure matters\.__ Keep a logical flow with clear sections\. Good layout helps both moderators and AI tools follow the conversation\.  

- __Label and tag where possible\.__ If your tool allows it, mark up themes or question types\. It helps with pattern\-spotting later\.  

- __Test how the guide works with your tools\.__ Upload it\. Check how it reads\. Make sure the intent is obvious enough that the outputs won’t drift\.  

- __Use tools built for qualitative analysis\.__ General\-purpose AI can miss what makes a session valuable\. Look for platforms that understand structure and context\.

__Start with a defined purpose__

Before a discussion guide gets written, there should be a clear sense of what the research is meant to explore\. This is often where things start to fall apart\. Too many guides are filled with general prompts, designed to cover a lot but say very little\. 

Your goal shouldn’t shape the answers, but it should shape the guide\. You’re not looking to confirm a hunch, just to get to a clear yes or no\.

Your guide should give structure to the conversation without turning it into a script\. It usually includes the topics you want to explore, the types of questions that will open them up, and a rough order to keep things flowing\. It helps the moderator stay focused, it gives consistency across sessions, and it makes it easier for others to make sense of what comes back\.

When AI tools are part of the process, the role of the guide becomes even more important\. The guide is what helps the tool understand the shape of the conversation\. 

You don’t need a tightly defined problem or a fixed framework but you do need a reason to be asking these questions\. That might be a gap in knowledge, a pattern that needs pressure\-testing, or a decision that’s waiting on more context\. The guide should reflect that\. It should be written to give the work direction, and to help everyone involved see where it’s going\.

## <a id="_na9f1ze3eubs"></a>__Build with analysis in mind__

A good discussion guide doesn’t just shape the conversation in the room\. It sets up everything that happens after\. If you’re planning to use AI to support the analysis, the guide becomes even more critical\. It’s what helps the tool understand what kind of material it’s working with\.

Before you start writing questions, think about what you actually want to be able to say later\. That might be product direction, messaging, behavioural trends, or something more open\-ended\. Whatever it is, the prompts in your guide should lead towards it\. Not in a way that forces the outcome, but in a way that creates clarity\. It helps both the moderator and the AI stay connected to the point of the session\.

This is also where tagging and labelling can make a difference\. If your tools allow it, mark the parts of the guide that relate to specific themes or business questions\. These signals give AI a better way to surface patterns and keep summaries grounded in what matters\. If you’re doing the analysis yourself, it still helps you spot links faster and avoid duplication\.

If the guide and the analysis aren’t linked, the outputs won’t hold up\. You’ll get surface\-level themes and interesting quotes that lead nowhere\. Work ends up getting repeated because no one is quite sure what it was for the first time\.

## <a id="_4ftl12z4uad1"></a>__How to build a guide that actually works__

You might already have a template you reuse\. You might have gone into ChatGPT and asked it to write one for you\. That can be useful as a starting point, but most of what comes back is too generic\. You receive open\-ended questions with no clear structure, and nothing that helps AI or human analysts derive meaningful insights from the results\.

Here’s how to write one that works:

### <a id="_5m7mq64fyons"></a>__1\. Start with the decision the research is meant to support__

Write this at the top\. One or two lines max\. What needs to happen next? What will this research inform? If the answer is unclear, the guide won’t help, and nor will the results\. This step focuses the whole thing\.

### <a id="_9b206oo5x5y8"></a>__2\. List what you actually need to learn__

Not topics, but things you genuinely need answers to\. These should connect directly to the decision above\. It doesn’t need to be formal; you’re just making sure the guide is useful\.

### <a id="_18ad3yojam63"></a>__3\. Build prompts that open up those areas__

Use open questions, but make them specific\. “Tell me about your experience” is vague\. “What did you expect going in?” or “What part didn’t work the way you hoped?” leads somewhere\. This helps the person running the session, but also gives clearer signals to AI tools\.

### <a id="_dmjpwhnymfgz"></a>__4\. Add notes for tone, flow and focus__

If something needs to stay neutral, say that\. If something is a warm\-up, say that\. If something is about pressure\-testing a message, say that\. These notes matter, especially when someone else is moderating or reviewing the data later\.

### <a id="_q3m4axlgxlif"></a>__5\. Keep the structure clear__

Break the guide into sections that follow a logical arc\. Beginning, middle, end\. Light, then deeper\. If it’s easy to follow, it’s easier to run and easier to analyse\.

## <a id="_umpkh4kq8mah"></a>__Help the AI interpret the guide__

Once you’ve pulled this together, try and feed it into your AI so it also can join in the conversation\. Uploading your document to a tool such as Aida from Beings will help create a tighter, more contextually relevant project \(especially if you have clear objectives in mind\)\.

However, it’s best practice to imagine that any AI tool may not fully understand nuance or intent\. They rely on structure and clarity\. If the guide is well organised and consistent, the output will be easier to trust and use\.

Follow these principles:

- __Be clear about the purpose of each question\.__ Explain whether it is setting context, testing a message, or confirming a view\.  

- __Group related questions under headings\.__ This makes the flow easier to follow, both for humans and software\.  

- __Avoid vague, open\-ended prompts\.__ Instead of asking, “Tell me about your experience,” ask, “What did you expect before starting?” or “What didn’t go to plan?”  

- __Use a consistent format across sections\.__ This helps reduce confusion and improves the quality of automated summaries\.  


Clarity in the guide leads to clarity in the results, especially when AI is used in the analysis\.

## <a id="_7sza2vyktbmb"></a>__Use tools that support qualitative structure__

If you’re using AI to support research, the tool you choose matters\. General\-purpose transcription or summarisation platforms can miss what makes a session valuable\. They’re often built to capture words, not meaning\.

Some tools are built around the structure of qualitative work\. They let you upload transcripts or recordings and analyse them in context\. That might mean tracking which questions landed well, spotting moments of hesitation, or identifying where conversations went off course\. It can also help when reviewing sessions across a team, especially if you’re trying to maintain consistency or spot good practice at scale\.

Good guides make good research easier to find, scale, and share, with or without AI in the mix\.
