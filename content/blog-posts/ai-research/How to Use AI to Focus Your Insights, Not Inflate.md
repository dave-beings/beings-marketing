<a id="_jwv43fxm4vkc"></a>How to Use AI to Focus Your Insights, Not Inflate

AI tools are making it easier than ever to produce insight decks at pace\. But with that speed comes a new problem…volume\. 

Instead of streamlining your workflow, AI can tempt teams to overdeliver, padding out presentations with half\-formed themes, repeated quotes, or polished content that doesn’t move the story forward\. What was meant to save time ends up taking more\. And worse, the signal gets buried in the noise\.

You might start with a clear goal, a focused brief, and even a few sharp hypotheses, but once the tools are in play, the volume begins to creep\. Comments that would once have been considered throwaway are now pulled in as quotes\. Those quotes become slides\. Themes get stretched, then split, then repackaged into new angles that weren’t part of the original thinking\. And because it all looks tidy and well\-labelled, it creates the illusion of depth, even when the thinking has not really moved forward\. It has simply expanded sideways\.

The result is work that feels dense but doesn’t carry any extra weight\. Decks become longer, not because they need to be, but because it feels safer to include everything that might be relevant rather than stand behind the few things that truly are\. And somewhere in that sprawl, the insight that could have made a difference ends up buried beneath a layer of polished but unnecessary content\.

## <a id="_ytdgpwtypvbm"></a>How to Use AI to Focus Your Insights At a Glance

AI speeds things up, but it can also clutter your decks\. Here's how to keep it sharp:

- __Start small: __AI gives you more than you need\. Tight prompts = tighter outputs\.
- __Cut the noise: __Not every quote needs a slide\. Keep what adds weight, drop what just sounds good\.
- __Beware false balance:__ AI treats everything as equal\. You need to decide what matters most\.
- __Don’t show your working: __You’re not delivering a transcript\. You’re telling a story\.
- __Review like a human: __Go back through the output\. Remove duplicates, fluff, or things you already said better\.
- __Use a checklist:__ Before adding anything, ask if it answers the brief, adds insight, or helps someone make a decision\. If not, cut it\.

### <a id="_trs2jkiajwc0"></a>__Start with less and stay there__

AI will always give you more than you need\. Upload a transcript and you will get a neat list of themes, often too many to be useful\. Some will be relevant\. Others will be half\-formed, loosely related, or repeated under slightly different labels\. 

__If you do not give the tool direction, it will fill in the blanks for you\.__ That is where the noise starts\.

This happens most often when the input is too open\. Questions like “what themes are in this?” or “summarise the key points” lead to volume, not focus\. The tool will mirror your uncertainty and try to cover every possible angle\. You end up with a long output that looks structured but doesn’t help you make sense of anything\.

The fix is not complicated\. Anchor your prompts in the actual job of the research\. Ask what speaks to the original brief\. Ask what challenges the current view\. Ask what might shift the decision being made\. Use the same judgement you would apply when reviewing a colleague’s early take\. 

__Is this helping the work move forward, or is it just there to prove you read everything?__

Try feeding the AI one transcript at a time, using a tighter question each round\. After that, review the output manually\. Keep what holds up\. Discard anything that overlaps, adds nothing, or only seems useful because it sounds like something you have seen before\. The goal is not to collect content\. The goal is to make decisions easier\.

### <a id="_1cnr9pr3s90j"></a>__Watch for artificial balance__

AI, when used without thought, can often present everything as if it matters the same amount\. 

It pulls themes from phrasing patterns, repetition, and surface\-level connections, then arranges them into neat clusters that all look equally significant\. A passing mention of colour preference ends up next to a recurring frustration about access or usability\. Without context, both are given the same visual and narrative weight\. The output feels complete on the surface, but the shape underneath can be off\. The structure is there, but the hierarchy is missing\.

This kind of flattening is common with broad, general\-purpose tools\. They are built to summarise efficiently, not to reflect what matters in the context of a specific brief\. You get volume and structure, but very little sense of which points actually shift the narrative or support the decision at hand\. 

Some tools are beginning to handle this more carefully\. You can set parameters that align with the original research question\. You can review themes alongside source quotes to check how much weight they’re carrying\. You can even trace how often certain views appear and see when a pattern is resting too heavily on one voice\. None of this removes the need for human interpretation, but it does give you a clearer sense of which parts of the story deserve space and which ones are just sitting there out of habit\.

The balance of an insight deck is about drawing attention to the things that move the work forward\. When that judgement gets blurred, whether by pressure, by habit, or by the way a tool structures its output, the work becomes harder to use\. If your AI setup helps you avoid that, even slightly, it’s already doing something useful\.

### <a id="_nd3enxxfchn"></a>__Not everything needs a slide__

When you’re working with AI, the output often looks finished before you’ve even begun\. The quotes are formatted, the summaries are clean, and the themes arrive in a way that feels ready to present\. The temptation is to include more of it than you normally would, just because it’s there\.

This is where decks get bloated\. You start justifying slide after slide not because the content earns its place, but because it looks convincing\. The volume creates a kind of false reassurance\. If you hand over more pages, it feels like you’ve worked harder\. If you include more voices, it feels more rigorous\. But that only holds if every page helps move the thinking forward\.

Sadly, many will see the output as validation from the AI, when the AI is simply offering everything you’ve given it\. 

Start treating AI output like a raw draft, not a set of ready\-made assets\. Ask yourself what the team actually needs to see to make a decision\. Think about the one or two ideas that unlock the rest of the conversation, then work backwards\. Anything that doesn’t support those ideas is just clutter\.

If you find yourself trying to build a narrative out of every generated quote, pause\. Choose the moments that shift perspective\. Choose the voices that add weight\. Everything else can stay in the background\. Your job isn’t to deliver a transcript with slides\. It’s to help the team see what matters faster\.

### <a id="_36yfth55hhq4"></a>__Ten questions to ask before adding anything to your deck__

If you're not sure whether something belongs in the final readout, use these questions to check yourself\. They don’t guarantee a perfect story, but they’ll help stop the sprawl and give you the validation to “kill your darlings”

1. Does this help answer the brief?
2. Would the client notice if this wasn’t here?
3. Is this quote saying something new, or just saying it nicely?
4. Are we including this because it matters, or because we feel we should?
5. Have we already said this elsewhere, in a clearer way?
6. Does this support a decision, or just describe what happened?
7. Is this here to show thinking, or to add insight?
8. Would this still be in the deck if we had five minutes, not fifty?
9. Are we giving this space because it’s loud, or because it’s important?
10. Have we done what good writers do and dumped everything in first, then cut hard afterwards? The first draft can be messy\. The final one shouldn’t be\.  


If the answer to most of these is no, it probably doesn’t need to be there\.
