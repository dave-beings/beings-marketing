<a id="_vp0jtq7wevaq"></a>\(Not Just a Hack List\)

If you’ve read our Founder Dave’s recent piece on using ChatGPT as a “strategy”, you might be wondering how to bring AI into your research process in a way that actually makes sense\.

Right now, most researchers are typically in one of two camps: excited but unsure how to use AI, or convinced it’s just another distraction\.

Both are right, but what researchers really need right now isn’t more shiny tools or 20\-tab prompt libraries\. It’s __structure__\. 

And the good news is, if you are already working as a researcher, then you already have it\.

Most commercial researchers are already working with established frameworks\. The opportunity now is to adapt those to include AI in a way that makes them stronger, not sloppier\.

In the UK, over [__14% of adults are now using generative AI at work__](https://www.deloitte.com/uk/en/Industries/tmt/research/digital-consumer-trends-2024-gen-ai.html), according to Deloitte’s 2024 Digital Consumer Trends report\. Yet a 2024 survey by the Market Research Society found that [__56% of UK research agencies have never used AI for data collection__](https://www.mrs.org.uk/pdf/MRS_Delphi_AI_Adoption.pdf), and nearly __half haven’t used it for deliverables__\. The gap is clear: individual researchers are experimenting, but structured organisational use is still lagging behind\.

Below, we’ll look at a few widely used research frameworks and show you how AI can be integrated thoughtfully into each one\. This isn’t about replacing researchers but about building workflows where AI becomes a useful assistant and not the boss\.

## <a id="_cmg7lrwjtc13"></a>__1\. Double Diamond Framework__

*\(Originally from design, but useful for any insight\-led process\)*

[Double Diamond](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/) works well for strategic qual\. It starts wide, exploring the problem space, before narrowing in on what matters\. Then it opens up again to shape ideas, before landing on what works\.

__How AI can support:__

- __Discover  
__Use tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Aida from Beings, to summarise previous research, scan public data, or explore early questions\. AI can speed up the desk phase without skipping rigour\.  

- __Define  
__Pull key themes from interviews, open\-text surveys or stakeholder notes\. AI can help identify patterns, but always check against what you’ve heard\. Useful for turning a wall of Post\-its into a clearer picture\.  

- __Develop  
__Co\-create stimulus, journey flows, or rough drafts of ideas to test\. This works especially well when you’re shaping propositions or audience frameworks\. Use it to prompt discussion, not to finalise output\.  

- __Deliver  
__Draft client summaries, internal outputs, or discussion starters\. You can also use AI to handle participant follow\-ups or summarise long recordings for speed\.  


## <a id="_t4g7i7xqxmf7"></a>__2\. Jobs To Be Done__

*\(A practical lens for understanding user motivation and context\)*

Jobs To Be Done is often used by strategy and research teams to uncover what people are *really* trying to achieve, and what gets in their way\. It’s especially helpful for identifying unmet needs, refining messaging, or shaping value propositions\.

__How AI supports JTBD research:__

- __Identify Jobs  
__Use LLMs like Aida, Claude or ChatGPT to help cluster raw qual into “job\-shaped” needs\. Feed in transcripts or open\-ended answers and prompt the tool to explore what the user was trying to do, not just what they said\.  

- __Map Struggles  
__Ask AI to pull out frictions, workarounds or decision triggers\. Useful when analysing customer journeys or interview transcripts, especially where barriers are buried in long stories\.  

- __Shape Opportunity Areas  
__Use AI to create early draft statements like “When I\.\.\. I want to\.\.\. So I can\.\.\.” or to group jobs by commercial potential\. This is helpful when preparing for ideation or client workshops\.  

- __Create Messaging  
__Once you’ve identified the job, AI can help generate copy that speaks directly to it, or at least assess copy to make sure it hits the mark, making JTBD outputs more immediately actionable\. Particularly useful when working with brand or campaign teams\.  


One quick tip: don’t let AI tidy the data too soon\. Sit with the raw material first\. See what stands out before you organise it\. The thinking still needs to start with you\.3

## <a id="_dvuqpracswgu"></a>__3\.  Thematic Analysis__

*\(A grounded, flexible method for turning raw qual into insight\)*

Thematic Analysis is a structured approach to coding and interpreting qualitative data\. It’s widely used in academic and commercial research and adapts well to strategic work, especially when you need to analyse what people say and pull out meaning that informs decisions\.

__How AI can support:__

- __Familiarise  
__Use tools like Aida, ChatGPT or Claude to transcribe recordings or summarise key parts of long interviews\. This speeds up early immersion but doesn’t replace the need to read the data yourself\.  

- __Code  
__Ask AI to suggest initial codes or flag recurring language and sentiment\. This can help when working through large volumes of data\. You still need to check for nuance, not everything that repeats is a theme, but it gives you a starting point\.  

- __Theme  
__Use LLMs to cluster similar codes together or draft early summaries of possible themes\. Helpful when spotting patterns or pressure points across audiences\. Some researchers ask Aida to generate “tentative insight statements” to test in team debriefs\.  

- __Review  
__AI can help compare themes across segments or audience types, but the decision about what matters \(and why\) needs human judgment\. This phase is where strategy takes shape\.  

- __Name and frame  
__Ask AI to generate name options for themes, but write the final insight yourself\. Real insight has tension, contrast or implication\. Remember that AI can help shape it, but not own it\.  

- __Deliver  
__ Use AI to draft different versions of the story for clients\. You might create a topline summary for the board, and a more detailed one for comms or product\. This is where generative tools save time without diluting quality\.

## <a id="_8wb0zft0ae0"></a>__Love Your Frameworks__

AI is exciting, it's powerful and sure, it can be fun\. We should know — we build AI tools for researchers\.

But good research still comes down to the basics: clear thinking, solid frameworks, and knowing what matters\.

The methods you've learned and the experience you've built aren't going anywhere\. They're what make insight land\. AI can help, but only if it works with you, not around you\.

Start from what you already know\. Use the tools where they make sense\. Keep the rest in your hands\.  
If you’re ready to bring AI into your research without losing the structure that makes it work, we’d love to show you how Aida fits in\. [You can try it for free](https://app.beings.com/auth/sign-in?returnTo=%252Fproject) and see how it plays alongside your process, not instead of it\.
