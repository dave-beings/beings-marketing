<a id="_1xluf4c0khuk"></a>What We Lose When We Forget Analog Thinking

I’m not a researcher, but I speak to a lot of them\. And one thing I keep hearing is that the old ways of working still had something valuable\. There’s a nostalgia for notebooks, Post\-its, scribbles on walls, even tape recorders\. Of course nostalgia can be rose\-tinted\. Nobody is wishing back the days of manually transcribing hours of interviews\. But there’s a reason people look back and feel like something has been lost\.  
  
__What You Need to Know__

__The problem  
__ Research has become obsessed with speed and digital shortcuts\. Every step is optimised, automated, or plugged into an AI tool\. The messy, slower, more human parts get skipped\.

__Why it matters  
__ Those slower parts often contain the spark\. When everything is flattened into neat dashboards and tidy summaries, you lose the nuance, the contradictions, and the half\-formed thoughts that make insight useful\.

__Where it breaks__

- Teams over\-index on tools and underplay curiosity  

- The “weeds” get tidied up too early  

- Outputs sound polished but lack substance  

- The process leaves little room for serendipity  

- Researchers forget how to sit with ambiguity  


### <a id="_s4ezhryd5oiv"></a>__Reflection On What Analog Still Gives Us__

Nostalgia can be deceptive\. The past often looks simpler than it really was\. But there is still something worth borrowing from it\. Anytime a process gets too complicated or bogged down in tools, going back to basics can be the reset button\.

Think about it\. Pick up a notebook, step away from the dashboard, and pretend it’s the 1980s\. No auto\-transcription, no AI clustering, no dashboards to tidy things up\. Just the researcher, the words, and the space to listen\. When you do that, the noise falls away and what you are left with is clarity\.

And here’s the thing\. That kind of analog clarity is not the opposite of digital or AI\. It is the thing that makes them more powerful\. When you know what matters from the raw, human part of the process, you feed better inputs into your tools\. The output gets sharper because the thinking behind it is sharper\.

### <a id="_3rggdtnp3ib7"></a>__The Science That Backs This Up__

Let’s drop the nostalgia for a second and lean into what the science is telling us\. Writing by hand isn’t just quaint, it does something the keyboard can’t\. An academic study showed that when people write on actual paper, [their brains light up more than when typing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/positively-media/202403/writing-by-hand-can-boost-brain-connectivity)\. The unique feel of paper, the spatial layout, the physical motion, it all creates stronger memory recall later on\.

[Another study found](https://time.com/3982285/bic-writing-hand-benefits) that writing by hand actually deepens brain connectivity\. This means that your memory, motor areas, and sensory regions are all working together in ways typing doesn’t trigger\. And that isn’t just neuroscience geekery\. It means when you slow down and write, you let your brain process more deeply, connect more dots, and build insights from the mess, not just tidy summaries\.

So maybe it is worth putting down the robot toolbox once in a while\. Grab a notebook, write things out the long way, let the process feel a bit awkward\. That clarity, the kind that only comes when you slow down, is exactly the fuel that makes AI outputs stronger when you do go back to the tools\.

### <a id="_ygpp92syk1ye"></a>__Bringing Analog and Digital Back Together__

The point is not to choose between old and new\. Nobody is asking for a return to cassette tapes or long nights of typing up transcripts word for word\. But if we only optimise for speed, we risk cutting out the very parts of the process that make insight meaningful in the first place\.

Analog habits such as writing, sketching, and sitting with ambiguity are not wasted time\. They sharpen the thinking, they force us to slow down, and they give us a foundation of clarity that digital tools can then build on\. When you take the time to notice what matters in the raw, human part of the process, the outputs from AI and other tools become stronger because the input is sharper\.

The future of research will not belong to the teams who rush from project to project, chasing efficiency at every turn\. It will belong to the ones who protect the slower moments, who give themselves space to process, and who know when to let their own thinking lead before they bring the technology back in to take it further\.
