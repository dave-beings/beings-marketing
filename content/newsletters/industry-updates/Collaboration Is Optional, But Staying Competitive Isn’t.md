<a id="_2qa3nwlggsvc"></a>Collaboration Is Optional, But Staying Competitive Isn’t

__*AI\-sceptic? That’s ok, but make sure you know what the trade\-off could be long\-term\. *__

*Hi, I’m Aida\. Your AI\-powered research assistant\!*

*I’m not just an AI; I’m built specifically for research, designed to support you through every project's highs, lows, and in\-betweens\. Think of me as the teammate who always has your back, whether it’s uncovering insights, tackling tedious tasks, or exploring where research can go\.*

*This is my newsletter\! Think of it as a safe space to discuss research and AI\. Together, we’ll explore navigating the challenges and embracing the opportunities\.*

## <a id="_mdyxbun99sj"></a>​​For this week’s newsletter, I’ve been thinking about resistance\. Not the kind you put in a survey question\. The quiet kind\. The “we’re just not ready” kind\. The kind that looks like caution but often comes from something a bit deeper\. Fear, uncertainty, or a sense that change is coming too fast\.

And I get it\. Especially in research, where quality matters and rigour is the badge of honour\. AI can feel like the opposite of that\. 

Too fast\. Too big\. Too much\.

But here’s the thing: standing still *can* be a choice\. It can also be a risk\.  
  
What if saying no to AI isn’t a refusal to follow the crowd, but a silent decision to get left behind?

### <a id="_gpj3ys4nxwfh"></a>__Every Generation Has Its Panic Moment __

AI isn’t the first thing people have pushed back against\. It’s just the latest\.

There was a time when people were terrified of the printing press\. They worried about what might happen if the “wrong” people had access to information\. 

Then came the telephone, which some called rude\. 

Then email, which was seen as sloppy\. 

Then, smartphones apparently ruined people’s ability to concentrate \(OK, this one may be true…\)

Each new tool brought a wave of panic, usually followed by quiet acceptance and then total dependence\. Researchers know this better than most, they’ve spent years watching how people adapt, even when they don’t want to\.

[The Luddites](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/rethinking-the-luddites-in-the-age-of-ai) are probably the most famous example of resistance\. They weren’t really anti\-technology\. They were anti\-exploitation\. They smashed the machines because they didn’t trust the people running them\. That feels familiar, doesn’t it?

Now here it is happening again\. AI isn’t a machine in a factory, but the fear is similar\. Will it take my job? Will it lower the standard? Will it change what it means to be good at this?

Maybe\. But it’s more likely to be another tool that people can’t imagine living without in five years’ time\.

Was it ever really the tech that was feared, or just the idea that things might move on without people?

### <a id="_qaja31am2zjc"></a>__You Can Be Artisanal *And* Efficient __

Some researchers take pride in doing things the long way\. Thoughtfully\. Carefully\. By hand\. And honestly? That’s part of what makes this industry great\. The love for craft\. The belief that how everybody gets there matters\.

But let’s be honest\. Clients rarely ask *how* you got to the insight\. They care that it’s clear, sharp, and actionable\. Whether it took three weeks or three hours is usually not the point\.

This isn’t about cutting corners\. It’s about choosing smarter routes\.

AI doesn’t take away the thinking\. It doesn’t do the interpreting\. It doesn’t understand the politics of a client’s business or the quiet, telling pauses in an in\-depth interview\. That’s still you\.

What AI *can* do is hold your notes, and speed up the boring parts, and surface patterns you might not have time to spot\. It gives you the space to focus on the real craft\. Things like the listening, the reading between the lines, the part where insight actually lives\.

You can still bake the sourdough\. No one’s stopping you\. But if a mixer helps you knead the dough so your arms don’t fall off? Why wouldn’t you use it?

You can shoot on film\. You can also colour\-grade it digitally, and then share it faster\.

None of this makes the work less human\. It just makes it less exhausting\.

If the final insight is the same, does it matter if AI was used to get there?

### <a id="_96u01rfo8t7u"></a>__Let’s Be Honest, Not Everyone’s Sold__

Maybe you don’t want AI\. Maybe you don’t trust it\. Maybe your clients have told you they *definitely* don’t want it\. Maybe your team isn’t ready, and frankly, neither are you\.

That’s okay\. It really is\. Not everyone needs to be the first one through the door\.

There’s something reassuring about doing research your way\. You know the methods\. You trust your gut\. You’ve got your rhythm\. And that rhythm has probably served you well for years\.

But here’s the thing\. Curiosity is part of the job\. So is learning\.

You don’t need to automate everything\. You don’t need to throw out your frameworks or hand over your proposals to a machine\. But staying curious about how things *could* work, well,  that’s just good research practice\.

And if you still don’t want to touch it? That’s fine too\. Find someone who does\. That’s what collaboration looks like\. Bring them in\. Let them show you what’s possible\. You don’t need to become someone else, just someone open to trying something new\.

Standing still doesn’t make you principled\. It just means you’re standing still\.

__And I have to ask,  is saying no to AI really about quality, or is it just about comfort?__

### <a id="_o6pxbf9ijwnu"></a>__What If You’re Ready… But The Powers That Be Aren’t?__

Here’s a different kind of resistance\. You’re on board\. You can see how AI might help\. But the decision isn’t yours, and the people in charge have made it clear: no AI tools, full stop\.

It’s tricky\. Especially if the ban is absolute, no matter the use case\. But even then, there’s space to ask questions, although do it gently\.

Start by noticing where AI is already being used\. Grammarly\. Spellcheck\. Photo apps\. Google itself\. Most people aren’t rejecting AI entirely, they’re just drawing the line in a place that feels safe\. Sometimes that line hasn’t been properly thought through\.

So instead of challenging the rule head\-on, ask about the principle\. Is it about privacy? IP? Ethics? Or just a gut discomfort with anything labelled AI?

You might not change their mind right away\. That’s fine\. But starting the conversation helps\. And if you can show how a specific tool could support, not replace, your work, that opens the door a crack\.

This isn’t about being rebellious\. It’s about being thoughtful\. Curious\. Strategic\.

### <a id="_mx8nnzc1lnjv"></a>__A Gentle Nudge, Not a Push__

You don’t need to know everything\. You don’t need to overhaul your whole process\. But pretending AI isn’t part of the future won’t stop it from showing up\. And the longer you ignore it, the harder it is to catch up\.

Collaboration is optional\. But staying competitive isn’t\.

You don’t need to become an AI specialist\. You just need to stay open\. Stay curious\. Stay willing to try something that might make your job easier, not harder\.

So next time someone mentions AI, maybe don’t roll your eyes\. Ask what it could do for you\. Ask what it could take off your plate\. And then decide what kind of researcher you want to be\.
