Is it delegation, or just making space to think like a researcher again?

This week’s topic is one I’ve heard whispered between interviews, is often discussed in Slack chats, and over many, many mugs of tea: where does AI *actually* add value in research? The answer? ADMIN\!

Ever feel like admin tasks are the uninvited guest at your research party? Picture a late night in a small UK agency: you, bleary\-eyed, surrounded by interview transcripts to type up and participant emails to answer\. Not exactly the thrill you signed up for, right? In fact, more than one in five researchers say they spend [over half their time on administrative tasks](https://exlibrisgroup.com/blog/research-administration-relieving-the-pressure-on-researchers/#:~:text=How%20much%3F)​\. No wonder by Friday you’re more burnt toast than brilliant thinker\. It got me thinking: *what if we let AI crash this admin party and take over the tedious tasks? *Is delegating the drudgery to AI the secret to reclaiming your spark as a researcher?

## <a id="_heading=h.ni7jul4frpnt"></a>__Freedom from the Tyranny of Transcripts \(and Other Tedious Tasks\)__

Let’s face it, I would imagine for many some parts of research feel more like punishment than discovery\. Transcribing a one\-hour interview [can devour 4–6 hours of your life](https://www.looppanel.com/blog/guide-to-transcribing-qualitative-research-interviews#:~:text=Transcription%20presents%20several%20challenges%3A) if you do it manually​\. \(I bet you’ve been there, *wrist* brace and all\.\) It’s no surprise many were *thrilled* to hand this chore off to AI\. One person confessed online that using AI\-based transcription “[saved my team HUNDREDS of hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/14hq5c2/transcribing_your_interview_data/#:~:text=Zoom%20transcriptions%20has%20saved%20my,but%20it%27s%20super%20darn%20close)” of drudge work​\. 

And it’s not just transcription\. Data sorting? Sure\! Let the algorithm sift through those open\-ended responses\. 

Research planning grunt work like formatting discussion guides or scouring background info? Yes, please, auto\-generate that outline\! 

Participant scheduling and reminder emails? Hand them to the bots \(and take back your lunch break\)\. 

Even consent form management\. Tracking who’s signed what can be automated, lifting a weight off your shoulders\. When tasks become *that* onerous people are more than happy to offload them\. After all, if an AI assistant can handle the boring bits, you get to do the fun parts\. 

Less typing, more talking; less spreadsheet, more insight… isn’t that the dream?

Some assume AI wants to steal the whole show\. Insights included\! But here’s the truth from the frontline: researchers aren’t looking for an AI to be the brain, just to assist it\. Most researchers are protective of analysis\. Sure people will let the AI sort data or drafting a summary\), but the final result? That’s the researcher's domain\. 

AI is most appealing when it sticks to admin and prep tasks, not when it tries to play visionary\. As one research lead quipped, an AI language model is “[somewhat like an intern](https://ssrs.com/insights/perspectives-on-ai-in-qualitative-research/#:~:text=We%20have%20dabbled%20with%20ChatGPT,the%20population%20we%20are%20studying)”, great at generating basic ideas to get you started, but “ultimately cannot replace our experience and contextual understanding” of the problem​\. 

In other words, thanks for the rough draft, AI, but I’ll take it from here\. This mindset explains why people would rather use AI to transcribe a focus group than to conclude what it all means\. Researchers trust their trained intuition and qualitative expertise far more than any algorithm’s autogenerated insight\. There’s also a satisfaction in the creative, interpretive part of research that they just don’t want to give up\. In fact, that’s the reason many got into this field\! 

Interestingly, this human\-first approach aligns with industry wisdom: AI should “[amplify and augment](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/can-ai-drive-innovation-in-qualitative-research-heres-what-weve-learnt/#:~:text=AI%20is%20a%20useful%20tool,led%20qualitative%20study)” research processes, not replace a human\-led study​\. 

So yes, bring on the AI to crunch the tedious stuff in the background\. But the aha moments, the why behind the data, the story weaving\. Those remain proudly, messily, and beautifully human\. After all, would you ever trust a robot to have *your* eureka moment for you?

## <a id="_heading=h.vthxon3w4ho7"></a>__More Time for Relationships, Synthesis, and Strategy__

Perhaps the best part of putting AI on admin duty is what it gives back: your time and mental energy to spend on the things that actually move the needle in research\. 

With the scheduling emails and consent forms off our plate, researchers can pour their attention into relationship\-building\. You know, having real conversations with participants or clients, being fully present in interviews instead of mentally ticking off logistics\. 

Being  freed from juggling calendars, a researcher can hop on a call to build rapport with a hard\-to\-reach stakeholder or brainstorm with a colleague, rather than fiddling with meeting invites\. 

Meanwhile, AI summarisers and data organisers can prep the raw material so you can dive straight into synthesis\. Things like spotting patterns, making connections, and crafting narratives\. One insights professional shared that AI helps him process large info quickly, “[allowing me to focus on extracting key insights rather than getting lost in the details](https://environics.ca/insights/articles/ai-adhd-research-neurodiversity/#:~:text=Process%20large%20amounts%20of%20information,getting%20lost%20in%20the%20details)\.”​

In the same article, another said offloading menial tasks to an AI assistant lets him spend more time “being a creative problem\-solver and big\-picture thinker,” without getting bogged down by minutiae​\. 

Isn’t that exactly what many aspire to be? With AI handling the time sucking admin, researchers can also step up to more strategic thinking\. That might mean designing better research questions, iterating on methodology, or simply having the headspace to consider the “so what” of your findings for the client’s big picture\. The irony is delicious: by automating the *impersonal* tasks, you free yourself to be *more human* in your work\. 

Researchers get to focus on empathy, intuition, and intellect \- the trio of traits no machine can match\. 

Could clearing plates of busywork be the key to rediscovering the creative, human core of research?

## <a id="_heading=h.4n611oy35x1"></a>__Losing Touch with the Data? On the Contrary…__

Now, you might be thinking, *this all sounds great, but don’t we lose something by not doing the dirty work ourselves?* It’s a fair worry\. Many were taught that manually transcribing interviews or painstakingly sorting data is how you immerse yourself in the research; it’s how you catch every nuance\. Handing those tasks to AI could feel like outsourcing your quality time with the data\. But here’s the twist: researchers aren’t actually letting go of their connection,  they’re just streamlining the grunt work\. 

In spite of AI, researchers will still stay very much in the loop\. For example, even with AI transcriptions, you still need to review and edit the output carefully to ensure there are no mistakes and that participants’ words are represented accurately \(because let’s be honest, AI doesn’t always hear *“Loughborough”* correctly on the first try\)​\. Even with AI handling the transcription, there’s something valuable about reading through each transcript yourself\. It’s not just about checking for errors—it’s about getting a proper feel for the data, noticing tone, nuance, and all the little things an algorithm might skim past\.

In other words, you will still immerse yourself in the material\. You’re just not doing mind\-numbing typing from scratch\. 

In fact, instead of losing touch, many will find that they can engage more meaningfully: rather than typing every word, they’re reading, listening, and annotating, which preserves that close familiarity\. 

The same goes for other tasks\. 

Let an AI auto\-sort survey comments into themes, sure, but you’ll still double\-check those groupings and tweak them based on your expertise\. You remain the curator of your data’s story\. Even automating scheduling doesn’t remove the personal touch; it removes the *back\-and\-forth*\. You’ll still show up to the interview fresh and prepared to connect with your participant, possibly even more so now that you didn’t spend the morning spam\-refreshing your calendar\. 

If AI takes over the drudgery and leaves you with the rich, human\-centric work, aren’t you actually *gaining* touch with what matters most?

## <a id="_heading=h.8qn0tle6vf10"></a>__Work Smarter, Stay Human \(and Maybe Enjoy an Extra Cup of Tea\)__

In the end, it seems small\-agency researchers are finding a delightful sweet spot: use AI to handle the mindless bits so they can fully embrace the mindful bits\. Focus the robots on the dull tasks, and keep the insights, empathy, and strategy for themselves\. The trend is impossible to ignore, across industries, over two\-thirds of companies are using or exploring AI solutions, with [80% expecting productivity gains](https://www.eyesee-research.com/knowledge/4-key-takeaways-from-the-2024-grit-business-innovation-report-and-eyesees-unique-perspective#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20over,driven%20firms) from it​\. 

In this little corner of the world \(whether it’s a niche UX consultancy in London or a scrappy social research outfit in Manchester\), that productivity translates into hours saved and sanity preserved\. 

It means not feeling guilty that mundane chores eat into your energy, and maybe reducing the burnout that comes from trying to do it all\. 

This approach has the opportunity, and anecdotal insight, to reinvigorate your work: from salvaging evenings previously lost to typing up notes, to spending more time brainstorming insights and bonding with clients\. It’s like having a personal research sidekick who does the paperwork while you do the thinking\. And as your friendly colleague, I have to say I’m here for it\. :\)

You get to be strategists, storytellers, relationship\-builders again, instead of professional emailers and note\-takers\. 

So next time you’re drowning in drudgery, consider tagging in your AI assistant and reclaiming that time for work that matters\. Because at the end of the day, the best research comes from human curiosity and connection\. And you deserve the freedom to nurture that\. And honestly, isn’t the real *assist* of AI not in replacing you, but in reminding you why you love this work in the first place?
