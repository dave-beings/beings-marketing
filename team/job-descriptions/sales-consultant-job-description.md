The Company  
Seed-funded startup Beings (https://beings.com/) is an end-to-end research platform that uses AI to transform how qualitative data is captured, processed and used.  
Meet Aida, your dedicated research agent, who automates up to 80% of the workflow while preserving depth, quality and accuracy.  
With the enterprise side of the business scaling with global tech as clients, the SaaS product is ready for market. This is where you come in.

The Role  
We are looking for a Sales Consultant to help small and mid-sized research agencies discover the value of AI-powered insights.  
This is a consultative sales role, focused on building trust, guiding prospects through the buying journey, and ensuring they feel confident adopting our AI SaaS solution.  
You’ll work closely with our growth and marketing teams to refine messaging, nurture inbound leads, and convert conversations into long-term partnerships.  
If you love helping customers solve real problems and prefer a relationship-driven sales approach over hard selling, this role is for you.

* Guide them through how AI-powered insights can enhance their work.  
* Deliver thoughtful, consultative sales conversations that build confidence in our solution.

Manage the Sales Process Smoothly

* Handle inbound leads and nurture prospects through demos, trials, and decision-making.  
* Use a structured yet flexible approach to help agencies evaluate and adopt AI.  
* Maintain a clear pipeline, ensuring seamless handoffs between sales and customer success.

Collaborate with the Growth Team

Drive Revenue & Long-Term Customer Success

* Focus on signing £20K ARR deals while keeping a strong customer-first mindset.  
* Ensure smooth onboarding and support customer retention & renewals.  
* Spot upsell opportunities and nurture accounts beyond the first sale.

Skills & Experience

* Experience in B2B SaaS sales, ideally selling to research agencies, insights teams, or professional services firms.  
* Strong consultative sales approach – ability to build trust over multiple touchpoints.  
* Experience managing deals in the £20K ARR range, with a 2–6 month sales cycle.  
* Comfortable guiding non-technical buyers through new technology adoption.  
* Highly organised, proactive, and collaborative—able to work closely with the growth team.

Bonus Points:

* Understanding of the research industry, market research workflows, or data analytics tools.  
* Experience with customer-centric sales methodologies (e.g., Challenger, SPIN, or MEDDIC).  
* Prior experience in a startup or scale-up environment where adaptability is key.
