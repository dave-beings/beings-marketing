## Why Now?

### 1. Accelerating Digital Transformation
- **87% of customers** expect companies to accelerate digital initiatives post-COVID (Salesforce)
- **63% of businesses** have accelerated digital transformation timelines (TIBCO)
- This rapid digital progression calls for new innovations in customer understanding capabilities

### 2. Untapped Potential of AI and Automation
- **75% of enterprises** name AI a critical business driver, yet only **17%** have extensively incorporated AI into their offerings (IBM)
- Natural language processing, computer vision, predictive analytics can transform consumer insights
- Cloud infrastructure finally allows enterprise-scale automation

### 3. Surging Demand for Empathetic Understanding
- **92% of CEOs** say deeper human-centric understanding key to growth (PwC)
- **55% of consumers** will pay more for greater understanding from companies (Capgemini)
- Loyalty stems from emotional connections more than convenience or price

### 4. Cost and Scalability Challenges of Manual Research
- Traditional qualitative research costs **$125,000+** per study (Beings)

- **87% of research leaders** say current methods fail to meet business needs (Quirk's)

### Market Conclusion
The market needs and technological capabilities now exist for an enterprise-ready automated insights platform like ours to disrupt a manual, analogue industry. Companies can no longer afford shallow or small-scale customer understanding. The next generation of corporate growth and loyalty will come from scalable, empathetic connections. The time to meet this new era of customer understanding is now.

## Problem

Customer research remains a manual, expensive, and siloed function at most large companies. Legacy approaches fail to meet the pace, scale, and intimacy required to deeply understand evolving consumers.

### Key Issues

#### Speed Constraints
- **Slow Speed**: Traditional market research techniques average over 6 months per study

#### Cost Barriers
- **High Costs**: Custom consulting projects can cost over $250k per qualitative study

#### Scale Limitations
- **Low Scale**: In-person focus groups capped at handfuls of consumers

#### Data Quality Issues
- **Weak Data Utility**: Survey fatigue yields unreliable quantitative insights
- **Lack of Empathy**: Static data fails to build genuine human connections

### Organizational Impact
As customers grow more complex, competitive differentiation will come from truly knowing their hearts and minds. But current organizational structures and outdated methodologies make this nearly impossible:

- **83%** of operations and insights teams feel obstructed by internal complexities and politics
- **72%** of researchers say they struggle to extract meaning from data
- **Only 29%** of CMOs believe they effectively act on insights

### The Core Problem
Ultimately, businesses fail to gather enough relevant and neutral information. They miss emerging trends, lose touch with changing needs, and lack the empathy required to build loyalty. Our platform flips this status quo.
