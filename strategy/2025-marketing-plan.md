### **✅ Key Milestones:**

1. **Launch “Coming Soon” or “Access Request” landing page**:

   * Incentivize sign-ups (early access, founder calls, exclusive features)

   * Add social proof if possible (e.g. "Backed by X", logos of previous companies)

2. **Start audience building** (one channel first, based on your audience):

   * **LinkedIn** for B2B / professionals

   * **Twitter** for tech/startup/CX communities

   * Post founder-led content regularly: behind-the-scenes, product design decisions, insights from early calls

3. **Cold outreach** to ICPs:

   * “We’re building X for Y, would love to chat and get your feedback” — not sales-y

   * Tools: Instantly, Apollo, Smartlead, LinkedIn InMail

4. **Customer discovery interviews** (20–30 minimum)

   * Document key pain points, terminology, objections, buying triggers

   * Use insights to refine product, messaging, pricing

5. **Build a waitlist** (aim for 100–200 signups):

   * Use viral loops (e.g. refer 3 friends \= get early access/features)

   * Test referral mechanics (SparkLoop, Viral Loops, etc.)

## **📈 Phase 2: First Users & Feedback Loop (Weeks 8–16)**

### **🎯 Objectives:**

* Acquire early users

* Learn what works

* Start building growth loops

### **✅ Key Milestones:**

1. **Alpha/Beta launch to small group**:

   * Give high-touch onboarding

   * Use “founder-led sales” – you handle onboarding, feedback, and support directly

2. **Early testimonials & case studies**:

   * Even small wins are valuable (“I saved 3 hours a week using this”)

3. **SEO Foundation**:

   * Keyword research for your category (start with bottom-of-funnel keywords)

   * Publish 2–3 high-intent blog posts

   * Consider programmatic SEO if you have structured data (e.g. comparison pages)

4. **Initial paid test (optional)**:

   * Test Google Search ads on high-intent terms

   * Or LinkedIn Ads for account-based marketing (if B2B)

5. **Launch on discovery platforms**:

   * **Product Hunt** (timing matters – do this when you already have advocates)

   * **Betalist, Hacker News, IndieHackers**, Reddit

2. **Community and advocacy**:

   * Launch Slack/Discord or small expert community
