# Vision 2030: The Large Behaviour Model

*Beings' long-term strategic vision for revolutionizing customer understanding through behavioral intelligence*

## Executive Summary

Beings has already mastered capturing and analysing the 'what' of customer conversations with the Personal Language Model. Now, with the Large Behaviour Model (LBM), we can unlock the 'why' behind those conversations.

**Going beyond 'Voice of the Customer' to understand and predict their behaviour.**

## The Evolution: Language + Behaviour

### Current State: Understanding What People Say
What people say only gets you so far with regards to understanding them. Traditional analytics rely on surface-level data and stated preferences.

### Future State: Understanding What People Do
**What people do proves what they believe.** The things that people believe are simplified by their mental model of the world and influenced by movies, stories, other people.

Unlike traditional analytics that rely on surface-level data, the LBM delves into the nuances of human behaviour, revealing hidden motivations and predicting future actions.

## The Problem with the Movie Version

There are lights, camera and action, but mostly there's the unreality of making it fit.

Happily ever after, a climax at just the right moment, perfect heroes, tension, resolution and a swelling soundtrack. Every element is amplified and things happen right on schedule.

Consume enough media and we may come to believe that our life is carefully scripted, and that we're stars of a movie someone else is directing.

This distracts us from the truth that real life is more muddled and less scripted. There is no soundtrack. We're actually signed up for a journey and a slog. Nothing happens ever after. It'll change, often in a way we don't expect.

We have no choice but to condense a story when we want to film it. Our real story, on the other hand, cannot be condensed, it can only be lived. Day by day.

### Implications for Customer Understanding
Traditional customer research often falls into the "movie version" trap—seeking neat narratives and clear-cut insights. The LBM recognizes that human behavior is messy, complex, and evolving, requiring sophisticated analysis that goes beyond surface-level patterns.

## The Large Behaviour Model (LBM)

### Core Concept
The LBM delves into the nuances of human behaviour—analysing conversations, facial expressions, purchase history, and more—to reveal hidden motivations and predict future actions.

### Vision Statement
**Imagine a world where Beings not only helps you understand what your customers are saying, but also predicts what they'll do next, allowing you to proactively tailor your products, services, and messaging to their individual needs.**

### The Netflix Analogy
Imagine the power of Netflix's recommendation engine, but instead of suggesting movies, it guides your customers towards their perfect purchase. That's the potential of the Large Behaviour Model. By analysing a wealth of behavioural data, the LBM can predict what your customers truly want and need, allowing you to personalise their experience, anticipate their next move, and build lasting relationships.

## Practical Applications

### Retail & E-commerce
**Fashion Retailer Example:** Use the LBM to recommend clothing items that match a customer's style preferences, based not only on their past purchases but also on their interactions with the website and social media.

### Software & Technology
**Software Company Example:** Use the LBM to suggest upgrades or add-ons based on how a customer is using their existing product, going beyond usage metrics to understand intent and satisfaction.

### Financial Services
**Financial Institution Example:** Use the LBM to recommend investment products based on a customer's risk tolerance and financial goals, inferred from their interactions with financial advisors and online banking platforms.

## Theoretical Foundation: Mental Models, Narratives & Archetypes

### 1. Narratives as Frameworks for Understanding
Humans are natural storytellers and story-consumers. Narratives provide a framework for understanding the world around us, organizing information, and making sense of experiences. Our mental models—the internal representations we use to interpret reality—are shaped by the narratives we encounter.

### 2. Archetypes as Building Blocks
Archetypes are recurring patterns of characters, symbols, and situations that appear across cultures and throughout history. They serve as building blocks for narratives and tap into universal human experiences. Examples include:
- The hero
- The villain  
- The mentor
- The journey
- The fall
- The redemption

### 3. Mental Models Shaped by Archetypes
Our mental models are populated with archetypes derived from the narratives we've internalized. These archetypes influence how we perceive ourselves, others, and the world. They shape our expectations, guide our behavior, and provide a sense of meaning and purpose.

### 4. Conforming to Variations
While archetypes provide a common framework, individuals express them in unique ways. Our mental models are shaped by a combination of universal archetypes and personal experiences. This leads to variations within archetypal patterns, reflecting individual differences and cultural nuances.

### 5. Implications for Understanding Behavior
Recognizing the role of narratives and archetypes in shaping mental models can provide valuable insights into human behavior. By understanding the underlying archetypal patterns that drive people's beliefs and actions, we can better predict their responses and tailor our interactions accordingly.

### 6. The LBM and Archetypal Analysis
The Large Behaviour Model (LBM) can be used to analyze behavioral data and identify the archetypal patterns that influence individuals or groups. This can help businesses understand their customers on a deeper level, personalize their experiences, and foster stronger connections.

## Market Context & Opportunity

### The Decision Complexity Problem
**Too many facts, too much data.**

A third of consumers globally are now spending more time making decisions and considering more brands, stores, and retailers. ([Think with Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/the-consumer-decision-making-process/))

### The Personalization Imperative
- **Hyper-personalisation** and a proliferation of choice create decision paralysis
- **People are unique**, but there are similar attributes that inform their behaviour
- **If you know how someone is likely to behave**, you can automate to support them through their buying journey

### The LBM Solution
The Large Behavioural Model addresses this complexity by:
1. Analyzing behavioral patterns beyond stated preferences
2. Predicting future actions based on deep behavioral understanding
3. Enabling proactive, personalized customer experiences
4. Reducing decision complexity through intelligent guidance

## Strategic Implications

### Evolution of Beings' Value Proposition
- **Current**: AI-powered qualitative research platform
- **Future**: Behavioral intelligence platform that predicts and guides customer actions

### Competitive Advantage
- Move beyond reactive research to predictive behavioral intelligence
- Create defensible moats through proprietary behavioral modeling
- Enable customers to anticipate rather than respond to customer needs

### Market Positioning
Position Beings as the leader in behavioral intelligence, not just research automation.

## Conclusion

People's mental models exist within a complex interplay of narratives and archetypes. By understanding these underlying patterns, we can gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and unlock new possibilities for connection and engagement. 

The LBM has the potential to revolutionize how we analyze and interpret behavior, leading to more personalized and effective interactions.

**Let's unlock the full potential of behavioural intelligence and revolutionise how businesses understand and connect with their customers. Join us in building the future of Beings with the Large Behaviour Model.**
