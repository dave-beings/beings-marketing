## Participant Profile
- **Name**: Isaline
- **Role**: User Researcher (Qual & Quant, primarily Qual)
- **Company**: REO (Conversion Rate Optimization agency)
- **Languages**: English, French, Spanish
- **Focus**: Website usability testing, accessibility research, CRO optimization
- **Location**: UK-based with international research capabilities

## Interview Context
- **Interviewer**: Anna Sandford-James (Scale Up Collective)
- **Purpose**: Understanding researcher needs for AI research tool development (Beings platform)
- **Format**: Remote video interview
- **Focus**: CRO agency research workflows and international research challenges

## Agency Context & Services

### CRO Agency Services
- **Primary focus**: Conversion rate optimization for client websites
- **Research types**: Qualitative usability testing, accessibility research
- **Platforms**: Mobile and desktop website optimization
- **Specializations**: 
  - Ease of use testing
  - Accessibility for mobility and visual impairments
  - International market research

### Client Workflow
- **Research feeds strategy**: Findings directly inform CRO optimization strategies
- **Moderated sessions**: Primarily live user testing
- **Output**: Actionable recommendations for website improvements

## Current Tool Stack & Challenges

### Tool Fragmentation Issues
- **Previous solution**: User Zoom (comprehensive but expensive after acquisition)
- **Current hybrid approach**:
  - **Recruitment**: Respondent.io
  - **Sessions**: Zoom
  - **Analysis**: Dovetail for transcription and clipping

### Tool Selection Criteria
**Ideal all-in-one tool requirements:**
- Recruitment posting capabilities
- Mobile and desktop recording
- Transcription functionality  
- Multi-country recruitment
- Affordable pricing

### Current Reality
- **Problem**: "It literally doesn't exist out there unless you pay a lot of money"
- **Workaround**: Expensive, time-consuming hybrid approach
- **Future plan**: Get more UX-only clients to justify expensive comprehensive tool

## International Research Challenges

### Multi-Country Recruitment
- **Previous tool limitations**: Zoom Go had basic geographic options (UK, Canada, US, "rest of world")
- **Issues with broad categories**: 
  - Too many irrelevant applications
  - Participants who don't speak required languages
  - Difficult to filter for specific countries

### Current Solutions
- **Respondent.io**: Better country-specific targeting
- **Askable**: Good for international recruitment with voice verification
- **Recruitment agencies**: For very niche, language-specific needs (Japanese, German, Portuguese)

### Language & Translation Workflow
- **Personal capability**: Conducts French and Spanish sessions directly
- **External support**: Uses translators for other languages (German, Portuguese, Japanese)
- **Translation challenges**: 
  - No integrated tools for non-English transcription
  - Must use multiple tools for different languages
  - AI subtitles require human verification ("some translations are just wrong")

## AI Tool Experience & Limitations

### Dovetail AI Functionality
- **Attempted features**: Auto-transcription, positive/negative sentiment tagging
- **Results**: "Very, very high level summary" that "doesn't catch all the nuances"
- **Specific issues**:
  - Misses contextual moments (hesitation, silence)
  - Basic word matching without context ("took words like 'bad' and tagged it as bad")
  - No understanding of qualitative research subtleties

### Current AI Usage
- **Heat map generation**: Uses AI tools to predict visual attention on website layouts
- **Process**: Copy-paste website â†’ AI generates heat map based on "millions of data points"
- **Application**: Validates design decisions before A/B testing

### AI Skepticism
- **Synthetic participants**: "I don't know if I trust synthetic participants... when are we gonna stop at some point everything's gonna be fake"
- **Quality concerns**: Prefers human insight over AI automation
- **Limited testing**: Acknowledges limited experience with AI tools

## Research Methodology & Process

### Presentation Approach
- **Video-first strategy**: "Show, don't tell" philosophy
- **Clip-based presentations**: 1-minute video clips demonstrating user struggles
- **Structure**: PowerPoint decks with embedded videos
- **Rationale**: "If you show a video of Johnny really struggling, they're like 'oh' - it speaks way more than telling them people struggled"

### Analysis Workflow
1. **Common theme identification**: Find patterns across sessions
2. **Clip selection**: Choose 3-4 key moments per session
3. **Context provision**: Explain methodology and participant demographics
4. **Recommendation development**: Include best practices from trusted sources (Baymard Institute)
5. **PowerPoint delivery**: Structured presentation with videos and recommendations

### Lab Capabilities
- **London lab**: Eye tracking, GSR (skin response), facial recognition
- **Mixed methods**: Combines qualitative insights with quantitative biometric data
- **Post-COVID reality**: "People don't really want to meet face-to-face anymore"
- **Limited usage**: Only a few lab projects per year

## Primary Research Challenges

### 1. Recruitment & Scheduling (Biggest Challenge)
- **Project management burden**: Becomes "project manager" role rather than researcher
- **Complexity factors**:
  - Client screener negotiations
  - Deadline pressures for niche participants
  - External disruptions (tube strikes, etc.)
  - Technical requirements (no glasses for eye tracking)

### 2. Tool Integration Overhead
- **Multiple platform management**: "You end up using like five different tools to do the job"
- **Time consumption**: Each tool switch adds administrative burden
- **Zoom webinar complexity**: Simple observer setup becomes "really time consuming"

### 3. International Research Complexity
- **Language barriers**: Finding qualified translators
- **Tool limitations**: No integrated multi-language support
- **Quality control**: Human verification required for AI translations

## Research Philosophy & Preferences

### Human-Centric Approach
- **Qualitative nuance priority**: Values human insight over AI efficiency
- **Context importance**: Believes AI misses crucial non-verbal communication
- **Quality over speed**: Prefers manual analysis for accuracy

### Practical Efficiency Needs
- **Administrative task reduction**: Wants less time on project management
- **Tool consolidation**: Prefers single platform over multiple tools
- **International capabilities**: Needs seamless multi-country, multi-language support

## Strategic Implications for Beings

### Key User Profile Insights
- **Small agency researcher**: Wears multiple hats (researcher + project manager)
- **International focus**: Regular multi-country, multi-language research needs
- **Quality-conscious**: Skeptical of AI replacing human insight
- **Efficiency-seeking**: Frustrated with tool fragmentation and admin overhead

### Critical Requirements
1. **Integrated international recruitment**: Multi-country, language-verified participants
2. **Seamless multi-language support**: Transcription and translation capabilities
3. **Administrative automation**: Reduce project management overhead
4. **Quality assurance**: Human oversight of AI-generated content
5. **Video-centric workflow**: Support for clip-based presentation approach

### Market Opportunities
- **Tool consolidation**: Address expensive, fragmented tool landscape
- **International research**: Better multi-language, multi-country capabilities
- **CRO specialization**: Features specifically for conversion optimization research
- **Small agency pricing**: Affordable alternative to enterprise solutions
