- **Anthropological toolkit**: Uses anthropological theories in UX context
- **Mixed methods capability**: Primarily qualitative with some mixed methods

## Primary Research Challenges

### Stakeholder Buy-In (Biggest Challenge)
- **20+ year persistent issue**: Convincing stakeholders of qualitative research value
- **Daily challenge**: Ongoing need to justify qualitative approach
- **Resource concerns**: Stakeholders view qual as expensive and time-consuming
- **Subjective perception**: Qualitative seen as less concrete than quantitative data

### Value Demonstration Strategies
1. **Effective communication**: How qualitative effectiveness is communicated
2. **Cost optimization**: 
   - Online interviews instead of in-person
   - Solo research approach to reduce costs
   - Self-transcription and note-taking
3. **Speed optimization**: Faster delivery to address time concerns
4. **Relationship building**: Personal connections to smooth stakeholder tensions
5. **Evidence presentation**: Show previous work and results
6. **Proof through results**: Demonstrate impact through completed projects

### Common Stakeholder Responses
- **Success cases**: Stakeholders impressed with results
- **Pushback scenarios**: "Let's do a survey instead" or "quantify your qualitative results"
- **Mixed outcomes**: Results vary by organization and stakeholder understanding

## Research Methodology & Process

### Analysis Approaches

#### Manual Analysis (Preferred)
- **Tools**: Excel spreadsheets, Microsoft Word
- **Process**: 
  - Organize open-ended comments in Excel
  - Filter and categorize responses
  - Color coding in Word documents
- **Speed**: Fast due to 20+ years of practice
- **Preference**: "Quite cathartic... put on music and analyze"

#### Tool-Based Analysis
- **Previous tools**: NVivo (before current version)
- **Current tool**: Dovetail (team requirement)
- **Experience**: "Not a big fan of Dovetail"
- **Issues**: Crashes, unintuitive interface, slows down workflow

### Collaborative Analysis
- **Code breaking**: Second researcher reviews and challenges analysis
- **Fresh perspective**: Prefers unbiased opinions from team members
- **Options**: Either co-interviewer or external team member
- **Process**: "I disagree with you, I agree with you, I see the pattern, I don't see this pattern"

### Transcription Workflow
- **Current setup**: Human transcription service (company-provided)
- **Manual backup**: Self-transcription for small projects
- **Previous experience**: Always manual transcription due to budget constraints
- **Resource awareness**: Acknowledges luxury of current transcription service

## AI Interest & Adoption Perspective

### Current AI Awareness
- **High interest**: "Very intrigued by the use of AI in qualitative work"
- **No current use**: Has not yet implemented AI tools
- **Learning approach**: Actively researching AI options
- **Motivation**: Need to stay current and marketable

### AI Learning Strategy
- **Research methods**: 
  - Google searches
  - LinkedIn publications
  - Industry talks and workshops
  - AI and research courses
- **Approach**: "Blanket search" and opportunistic learning
- **Timeline**: Learning "whenever I have time"

### AI Application Areas of Interest
1. **Transcription**: Primary area of interest for efficiency gains
2. **Analysis support**: Curious about AI assistance in thematic analysis
3. **Speed optimization**: Ways to accelerate research process
4. **Human touch preservation**: Maintaining personal connection in sensitive research

### AI Limitations Recognized
- **Sensitive populations**: Need human touch for marginalized communities
- **Trust building**: Personal connection essential for sensitive subjects
- **Interview conduct**: Human interviewer necessary for building participant trust

## Organizational Context

### Team Dynamics
- **First qual team experience**: Previous roles as solo qualitative researcher
- **Resource constraints**: Historical lack of analysis tools and budgets
- **Self-reliance**: Developed efficient manual processes out of necessity
- **Tool awareness gap**: Company lacks awareness of available AI tools

### Current Tool Evaluation
- **Company interest**: Organization exploring AI tool options
- **Personal research**: Individual initiative to learn about available tools
- **Knowledge transfer**: Plans to bring AI knowledge to future roles
- **Market positioning**: Staying competitive through tool awareness

## Strategic Implications for Beings

### User Profile Insights
- **Experienced solo researcher**: 20+ years of self-reliant practice
- **Anthropological perspective**: Deep understanding of human behavior and cultural context

- **Change-ready**: Open to AI adoption for efficiency gains

### Key Requirements
1. **Transcription automation**: Primary area for immediate AI value
2. **Analysis acceleration**: Support for thematic analysis without losing human insight
3. **Intuitive interface**: Tools that don't slow down experienced researchers
4. **Sensitive data handling**: Appropriate for research with marginalized populations
5. **Cost-effectiveness**: Affordable solutions for budget-conscious organizations

### Market Opportunities
- **Solo researcher support**: Tools for independent researchers without team support
