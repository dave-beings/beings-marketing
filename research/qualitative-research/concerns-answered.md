Concerns around accuracy 

What architecture/model is Aida based on? Earlier models like GPT3.5 were terrible at hallucinating, so does GPT4.0 

OpenAI GPT4. We're integrating Google Gemini as well so users can select which one they want to use. 
Rev ai for transcription. 

People want to do wider assessments of ai analysis models e.g. vs other models and vs human analysis. 

AI is some distance away from being trained to the level of an expert researcher. What data is Aida trained on? 

Aida is using publicly available research data that has been used to train larger LLM models GPT4 and Gemini. Beings strictly integrates the best tool available so the data used to train aida is what has been used to train those models.

Beings is working on developing a personal language model that can learn from your own research data, industry and product rather than solely relying on publicly available data that may not be relevant. 

At the moment, AI models have the decision making responsibility and expertise of a 10 year old and therefore the responsibility for making decisions falls on the researcher. This can be achieved through intelligent prompt engineering, so taking responsibility for asking intelligent questions and phrasing your requests for AI to make  decisions in a responsible way. 

Rubbish in/rubbish out. The quality of the prompts you are using determines the success of the model, but most people haven’t been trained to leverage AI properly. 

At the moment, AI models have the decision making responsibility and expertise of a 10 year old and therefore the responsibility for making decisions falls on the researcher. This can be achieved through intelligent prompt engineering, so taking responsibility for asking intelligent questions and phrasing your requests for AI to make decisions in a responsible way. 

Beings has created a framework for aida which profits from prompt engineering so people can get more suitable responses to their queries based on their projects, basically helping them ask the right questions to aida. 

Initially beings will provide generic prompts to help researchers get started using Aida such as prompts to summarise a meeting or ask specific questions. Over time, aida will learn from the researcher’s own prompts and expertise, the context/field/industry of the project and provide more tailored prompts to help researchers be more productive and get relevant answers. 



AI needs to be trained with the contextual understanding of the business objective. How does this work with Aida not using your data collected during requirements setting sessions to learn?

Qual researchers are aware of the concept of saturation. Aida has already reached saturation in her understanding of project requirements having been trained on mass amounts of data used by GPT4 and gemini. 

The goal is to develop a custom ai to enable aida to use the data she collects throughout the  project to continuously improve her understanding and provide more relevant and tailored analysis over time. 

Beings is currently interviewing ai engineers to create this custom model, a personal language model or adaptive AI.

What types of research can be run through beings platform? Important when considering the budget. 

Beings is suited to 121 interviews and qual focus groups. 

She will then expand to integrate with survey tools for qual surveys. 

She will then expand to do quant analysis. 

Are a certain number of participants included in the subscription? 

Not sure yet, immediately the integration just saves time from them having to have a segmented workflow. 

How does Aida integrate with other tools e.g. user testing, repositories. 

She will integrate well, the aim is not for the researcher to need to do the entire process through beings, but use aida at various stages e.g. project planning or analysis. 

What level of abstraction can she get to? Using atomic research approach/grounded theory 

Write a summary of the transcript from the meeting including 1. Percentage talktime 2. Meeting Purpose, 3. Key Themes, 4. Key Topics, 5. Key Actions, 6. Key Sentiment, 7. Quantitative insights, 8. Qualitative Insights, 9. Key questions with detailed answers  10. Hidden patterns
