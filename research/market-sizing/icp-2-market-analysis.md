# ICP 2 Analysis

## Market Research

# Overview

DevelopmentCorporate has reviewed Beings’ [2025 Persons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARwEHVgh2zzpEoNq6IA35cJu5FSfxg-5dVRSLuucfj8/edit?usp=sharing)and [2025 ICP TAM SAM SOM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bKG1DBVeTk02z2OnGrIkuupBsUsNYkP3FywfpL9HoxE/edit?usp=sharing)documents. This analysis is a first step in refining the firmagraphics part of the ICP. 

The key question is Beings a fit for ICP 2: The Agile Research Agency? The numbers show that there is a clear opportunity:

## Data Breakdown

Generative AI is a useful research tool, but some tools are better suited than others. DevelopmentCorporate subscribes to the premium editions of ChatGPT, Grok3, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Perplexity. This document shows the raw results of our initial prompts 

[Generative AI Analysis UK Marketing Agency Market](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yWmPjCkPlMF1AOXog56W8ySEtxY_xEp7G8U-c7m3-_Y/edit?usp=sharing)

For this analysis, we found that Grok3 produced the most credible information.

## Geographic Region Summary

### UK

For the UK, SIC code 73200 is our anchor. The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Companies House provide business population data. According to the ONS “UK Business: Activity, Size and Location” (2023), there were approximately 5,700 enterprises under SIC 73200 in 2022\. Size breakdowns are trickier, but the ONS “Business Population Estimates” suggest that:

* SMB (1-49 employees): \~90% of UK businesses fall into this category across industries, with market research likely similar due to its service-based nature. Estimate: 5,130 (5,700 × 0.9).

* MidMarket (50-249 employees): \~8% of businesses. Estimate: 456 (5,700 × 0.08).

* Enterprise (250+ employees): \~2% of businesses. Estimate: 114 (5,700 × 0.02).

*  Total: \~5,700.

Source: ONS “UK Business: Activity, Size and Location” (2023) and “Business Population Estimates” (2022). Note that these are approximations, as exact size splits for SIC 73200 aren’t publicly granular.

Out of the 5,700 UK agencies, there are 2,185 pure play Market research and public opinion polling entities. 3,515 agencies that list multiple SIC codes (42 additional categories).

### EU

The EU (excluding the UK post-Brexit) is more complex due to 27 member states and varying statistical frameworks. Eurostat’s “Structural Business Statistics” (NACE Rev. 2 code M7320, equivalent to SIC 73200\) provides a starting point. In 2021, Eurostat reported \~17,000 enterprises in “Market research and public opinion polling” across the EU. Size distribution follows broader EU trends:

* SMB (1-49 employees): \~92% of EU businesses are small, per Eurostat. Estimate: 15,640 (17,000 × 0.92).

* MidMarket (50-249 employees): \~7%. Estimate: 1,190 (17,000 × 0.07).

* Enterprise (250+ employees): \~1%. Estimate: 170 (17,000 × 0.01).

* Total: \~17,000.

Source: Eurostat “Annual Enterprise Statistics by Size Class” (2021). This is an aggregate estimate, as country-specific data (e.g., Germany, France) varies, and not all nations report size splits consistently.

### USA

For the USA, NAICS code 541910 (“Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling”) aligns with SIC 73200\. The U.S. Census Bureau’s “County Business Patterns” (2021) reported \~7,200 establishments in this sector. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) notes that 99% of U.S. firms are “small” (often \<500 employees), but we’ll refine this:

* SMB (1-49 employees): \~85% of service firms, per Census data trends. Estimate: 6,120 (7,200 × 0.85).

* MidMarket (50-249 employees): \~13%. Estimate: 936 (7,200 × 0.13).

* Enterprise (250+ employees): \~2%. Estimate: 144 (7,200 × 0.02).

* Total: \~7,200.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau “County Business Patterns” (2021) and SBA “Firm Size Data” (2022). Establishment counts may slightly overstate unique firms, as some agencies have multiple locations.

## Raw Company House Data

By investigating links in the data sources cited in various generative AI analyses, DevelopmentCorporate was able to download a list of 5,000 Company House entries for NACE code 73200 Market research and public opinion polling. About 43% of the entries had one NACE code for Market research and public opinion polling. The remaining entries had multiple. A total of 42 codes were included.

This data could be used later for further research. You can access the raw data here: [Market Research Agencies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_xwfe4BwbV2fs6021CjiRS4YVEAY9jFc0t_rjdcms8/edit?usp=sharing)

# Packaging

The needs of MidMarket and SMB agencies are different than those of enterprise-scale agencies or commercial entities. The primary challenge faced by MidMarket and SMB agencies is whether an investment in a qualitative research platform offers enough benefits (productivity, quality, analytical capabilities, etc.) to justify the cost.

Mid-market companies investing in SaaS solutions [typically expect 3-5x direct financial ROI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-roi-do-midmarkets-firm-ex-ogxb5UN5S5uz3V9mSrMA1w) on their software investments within 24-36 months, with top performers achieving returns exceeding 8x through optimised adoption and operational efficiencies.

Almost all SMB and MidMarket firms have existing automation solutions that address all or a part of the research process. DevelopmentCorporate, a typical SMB organization, does a fair amount of qualitative research projects. We use a variety of point solutions to automate parts of the research process (Zoom, Meet, Fathom, Prolific, various Generative AIs, etc). When considering potential research platforms, we calculate the incremental benefit a solution can provide versus the cost to acquire and operate a potential integrated platform. We have found that even the most affordable products are not economically feasible. We would either have to accept radically reduced profit margins or increase the prices we charge to the point of being uncompetitive. UK SMB/MidMarket firms probably face the same challenges. 

The pricing of current solutions for small teams (5 active users) is around $20,000+/year.  In the past six months, DevelopmentCorporate has conducted multiple secret shopping projects, including engagements with Marvin, UserTesting, Discuss.io, and Condens. The same persona was used for each shopping:

* I do a lot of moderated qualitative research like Win/Loss Analysis for enterprise software companies like Condens, persona validation for startups, restructuring analyses for software companies in trouble, and large scale market research studies for enterprise software product management teams

* I do some quantitative research studies, but no significant app usability research

* I source most of my research panels on my own. I also use Prolific and qualitativetrics

* I have a team of ten contractors that work with me \- 6 researchers, 3 analysts, and 1 VA

* I anticipate we will do about 500 in depth interviews next year across 20 projects. We may do 10 unmoderated projects targeting 1,500 participants.

A summary of the pricing discovered:

| Vendor | Annual Platform Cost | Estimated Other Costs | Cost /User /Year | Comments |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| UserTesting | $14,800 | $57,600 | $24,400 | 6 Seats, Unlimited projects, 500 Session units/month |
| Discuss | $32,800 | $0 | $10,933 | Seat based pricing,Unlimited projects, 6 seats |
| Marvin | $36,000 | $0 | $6,000 | Standard Plan, 6 Seats, unlimited projects, |
| Condens | $8,400 | $0 | $1,400 | Business Plan, 9 seats, Unlimited transcription |

Using the Beings price calculator, a similar quote would be about £19,200.

Beings should consider developing a “lite” version of its solution, tailored to fit the smaller needs of SMB and MidMarket firms. 

# Willingness To Pay Study

Beings should consider doing a little [dogfooding experiment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2019/12/09/why-software-organizations-eat-their-own-dog-food/) to evaluate SMB and MidMarket firms' willingness to pay for a qualitative research platform. It would be interesting to see prospects' reactions to a £1,000, £5,000, £10,000, and £20,000 annual price point for a Beings solution. 

Beings could survey 360 of the SMB and MidMarket firms contained in the [Company House dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_xwfe4BwbV2fs6021CjiRS4YVEAY9jFc0t_rjdcms8/edit?usp=sharing) provided earlier in the analysis. This would be a [statistically significant sample](https://chatgpt.com/share/67c5bbae-8360-800b-b962-62ebee8858e0). Using Beings’ Prolific capabilities, Beings could develop a fact-based, bottoms-up understanding of the UK SMB and MidMarket potential. Side benefits would be having an email list for future SMB/MidMarket marketing and sales efforts and developing content for a case study.
