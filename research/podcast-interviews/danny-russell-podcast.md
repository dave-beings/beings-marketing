Dave (00:00.128)
it just to keep it nice and simple. So yeah, me a bit about your week as a bit of a warm up. Was it good?

Danny Russell - DRC (00:06.551)
Yeah, so in fact I spent Tuesday in a recording studio in East London, doing for one of the agencies, a couple of sessions for the summit that we've got coming up in October and a couple of just recorded content that they wanted. So yeah, that was a heavy day. Well, just one after the other rolling in, but...

Dave (00:12.536)
Hell no way, what was that for?

Dave (00:22.542)
Nice, cool.

Dave (00:29.646)
Nice, very good.

Dave (00:35.478)
Well, did it go alright? Yeah, cool, good. Excellent. So yeah, I'll try and keep it sort of fairly, fairly brief. Did you see the notes that I sent through? Did you have any kind of feedback on those? Are you kind of happy with that kind of narrative flow? Excellent. And then I just want to check with you. I'm just going to read you my introduction, just in case I've got anything wrong.

Danny Russell - DRC (00:36.099)
Yeah, it was good fun. Yeah, no, it went really well. It was good fun.

Danny Russell - DRC (00:49.313)
Yes, yeah. No, No, that's all good. Yeah, that's all good.

Dave (01:03.854)
in there or anything you'd rather was done differently. So I'll say, you know, welcome to the podcast, but then I'll say kind of Danny Russell has led insight and strategy at some of the UK's most iconic brands, Sky, British Airways, Telefonica, just to name a few. He's chaired the MRS Fellows Board, helped shape the research agendas of global agencies and now advises companies across the insight world on how to grow, differentiate and stay commercially sharp.

Danny's one of the most thoughtful voices on what AI really means for researchers, not just in theory, but in practice. In this episode, we're gonna dig into his origin story, his career highlights, and the moment an AI chatbot made him stop in his tracks. We're also gonna talk about what needs fixing in the industry, why the insight to impact GAP still haunts so many projects, and how we can do it better. Let's get into it, and then I'll just kind of say, you know, hi Danny, how you doing? And then we'll launch into.

Danny Russell - DRC (01:54.116)
Okay, so the only change on that is if you can put that he has chaired the Market Research Society and Aura.

and sits on the MRS Fellows Board.

Dave (02:14.478)
Okay, so he's chaired the Market Research Society itself.

Danny Russell - DRC (02:16.781)
So he's chaired the Market Research Society and AURA, a URA, and he is a member of the MRS Fellows Board. So I think the language that you used was that I was currently chair of the MRS Fellows Board. Yeah, so that's not quite right.

Dave (02:21.026)
the Amherst

Dave (02:37.24)
share. He's chaired, yeah, okay, gotcha. Gotcha, so he's chaired the Market Research Society and Aura and he's also a member of the MRS Fellows Board, helped to shape research agendas of global agencies and now blah blah blah. Cool, okay, great. So let's run it, we can stop and start, we can redo stuff, if there's anything you're really not happy with, and again I'll share it with you afterwards, so it's, yeah, it's not a problem. So yeah, I'm gonna start with, if you're ready, I'm gonna...

Danny Russell - DRC (02:48.963)
Perfect.

Danny Russell - DRC (02:59.511)
Yep.

Danny Russell - DRC (03:07.479)
So Dave, just to understand, because having done the podcasts on Tuesday, all they did was they just ran the whole video and then they'll do the edit afterwards. If I make a mistake or when I make a mistake, do you want us to sort of stop and we have to go back and start again?

Dave (03:07.598)
Okay, go on. Yeah, yeah.

Dave (03:16.664)
Yeah, okay.

Yes.

Mm-hmm. Ha ha.

Dave (03:28.874)
It will depend a little bit on the nature of the mistake. I will probably just ask you to pause and maybe restart that sentence rather than having to go back to the start of the question or anything. But if for like some...

Danny Russell - DRC (03:39.765)
Okay, look, I'll be... Rather than me try and second guess it, you know what you want. You just tell me what to do.

Dave (03:48.335)
Cool, fabulous. All right, well, let's get started. Welcome to the Beings podcast. We're exploring the changing face of research in an age of AI automation and accelerating expectations. Today's guest is someone who's been at the heart of that change for over 30 years. Say good morning, Danny.

Danny Russell - DRC (04:07.245)
Good morning everybody.

Dave (04:09.122)
Danny Russell has led insight and strategy at some of the UK's most iconic brands, Sky, British Airways, and Telefonica to name a few. He's chaired the Market Research Society and Aura, and he is a member of the MRS Fellows Board and has helped shape the research agendas of global agencies, and now advises companies across the insight world on how to grow, differentiate, stay commercially sharp. I'm gonna re-record this. Danny's one of the most thoughtful voices.

on what AI really means for researchers, not just in theory, but in practice. In this episode, we're gonna dig into his origin story, his biggest career highlight, and the moment an AI chatbot made him stop in his tracks. We also talk about what needs fixing in the industry, why the insight to impact gap still haunts so many projects, and how we can do better. So let's get into it. Tell me, Danny, how did you get your start in the world of research and strategy?

Danny Russell - DRC (05:02.679)
Thank you, Dave. My story started with my industrial placement year at university. I was fortunate enough to work for a pretty small research agency, but it had huge reach. So the biggest clients were Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal,

and we did a lot of work in ASDA and Tesco at the time. And that's what really started me off in the research world. I know a lot of people say they fell into market research. I guess you could say I did as well, but it was because of that industrial placement year when I was out at university.

Dave (05:50.156)
Nice, and what did you find that was exciting about it or particularly challenging about it that kind of made you stick?

Danny Russell - DRC (05:57.034)
It was challenging because we were students and they worked us pretty hard, but I loved it. So we were working on brand new products. So this does date me, but the first ever shampoo and conditioner was a product called Wash and Go Procter & Gamble. And it was

unique but there was no other shampoo and conditioner joint product. They had no idea where to locate it. Does it go in the shampoos? Does it go in the conditioner? Do you have to put it in the middle? And they certainly had no idea about how to price it.

So could they get away with adding the price of the shampoo and the conditioner together? I basically doubling the price. And what the agency that I was working for did was actually place that product in store and monitor the sales.

So it was great. I loved it. Like we were going in overnight, completely redressing the whole of the shampoo and conditioner section in chemists and in supermarkets and then monitoring the sales of the product, changing the pricing, changing where we located it. It was great. mean, Procter & Gamble, we did the very first

nappies that contained a new formulation to that would that would wick the dampness away from a baby's skin. And again, completely unique product. They had no idea how it was going to go down. And we test marketed that in Jersey because we were able to then stay in touch with all the doctors to make sure that

Danny Russell - DRC (07:52.142)
there were no particular skin irritation issues that were being caused by the product. So it was genuinely innovative product launches that were the decisions, huge decisions being taken off the research that we were doing. So it was really exciting. I loved it.

Dave (08:09.934)
It sounds fantastically analogue as well, know, really kind of hands-on stuff in the real world. Were you always interested in how people think or in how businesses kind of make these sorts of decisions?

Danny Russell - DRC (08:23.395)
Yes, yeah, I mean, think that came from my father. was a he was in marketing, sales and marketing. And I just remember used to go down to his company's warehouse when I was a young child and completely against health and safety. Obviously, I'd be driving around on the forklift trucks, which, you know, as a seven, eight year old lad was just brilliant. But it was I think that's what got me into it.

And yeah, was never a time I wasn't going to go into some sort of business or marketing role.

Dave (09:01.838)
fantastic. You've worked with some fairly iconic brands, know, Sky, British Airways, Telefonica, to name a few. What would you say has been your favourite job or project over the years and what was it that made it so memorable?

Danny Russell - DRC (09:15.967)
It'd have to be British Airways. I find, I still do to this day, I find airports genuinely exciting and emotional. Departures is exciting. You look up at the board and you see a list of a hundred different countries and cities around the world and...

Dave (09:42.178)
Mm-hmm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (09:43.8)
you've got this hub of people that have come together and they're all just going to disperse out around the world. And at British Airways...

Flying really means a lot to people. Whether you're flying on holiday with your family or you're flying back to see a loved one who might not be feeling very well or you're flying on business, I think it's one of those transport mediums which is, because you're traveling, you tend to be traveling overseas, it tends to mean a lot. so therefore from an insight perspective,

People genuinely want British Airways to be doing well because they want their flight to go well. And so from an insight perspective, unlike, for example, without disparaging certain FMCG companies that I've worked for, Margerine,

Yeah, it has a place in my life, but not to the extent. Yeah, not quite, not quite the same.

Dave (10:53.006)
doesn't quite hold the same meaning.

So tell me a little bit more about that project. What was it all about, the project with British Airways?

Danny Russell - DRC (11:02.835)
so there was the one, yeah, the one particular project that stuck out for me was we relaunched First Class. And up until that point, First Class had got a bit stuffy and basically airlines were just trying to get, we got into this ridiculous race about who had the softest leather seats.

I remember an airline came out, heard an airline was coming out with, I think it was kangaroo leather, which apparently was much better than cowhide leather. the seats were getting kind of bigger and softer and people, airlines were putting chefs on board to hand prepare.

meals for first class customers. Anyway, it was just getting ridiculous. And we wanted to do something different. I was on the project team for first and we took a look at the data because obviously we had the data, we had our frequent flyer program.

Dave (12:01.486)
Yeah, yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (12:16.459)
Most people that flying first are in the freak, were in British Airways exec club. We took all that data, but the best thing about it was we undertook a load of observation. And there's only two different types of people that can afford to fly on first. They are either independently wealthy, so they're flying their.

Dave (12:28.598)
Nice.

Dave (12:33.666)
Hmm. Hmm.

Danny Russell - DRC (12:39.137)
they're flying in first because they can or they're flying in first because their company wants them to arrive at the destination fresh. And so the company's paying for it. And so from an observation perspective, it was really interesting because the independent wealth, the independently wealthy are just there to sort of enjoy themselves. They want movies and they want, they want good food. The business people is two reasons. One is they want to sleep.

And the other thing is they'll quite often have another person from the company traveling further back down the airline. So either in business class or economy. And quite often those two people needed to get together in order to run through the meeting or run through the deck. So we did this observation and we totally relaunched first. We put a proper bed in it. And again, this dates me because

Dave (13:17.836)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (13:39.584)
even business class now you have beds, but trust me, when this was launched, no other airline offered a flat bed. We had a sleep ergonomic expert come in to help us and it doesn't matter how far you can push a seat back. You won't get a good night's sleep unless you can lie down. And...

Dave (13:52.334)
Amazing.

Danny Russell - DRC (14:04.767)
So all this was completely revolutionary at the time and we invented this bed and we put it up in the air and we put a buddy seat on the other end of the bed so that the person from further down could come forward. The tables were big because again the independently wealthy wanted to lay their food out. They wanted, they didn't want the silly little side tray that you pull out from the thing. So lots and lots of little different things that completely

Dave (14:28.834)
Yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (14:34.841)
revolutionized first-class travel and in the two to three years that it took the other airlines to catch up it was it was incredible and I loved it because it was contextualized information so we took the data that we had we took this sleep ergonomic expert we did all that observation work

And of course, we spoke to customers as well, but we took all the information, contextualized information and brought it together into the insight.

And that's what was designed. At no point did anybody in the airline say, we shouldn't do this because of this reason or that reason or budget. We absolutely went for it. Product was phenomenal. It did really, really well. And everybody copied it. In fact, it then started to seep through into the business class as well. So that is the story of how seats went from no matter how far they tip back.

Dave (15:16.258)
Hmm. Hmm.

Dave (15:22.69)
Yeah, yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (15:31.819)
to flat beds and suddenly you can now get on a flat bed and sleep for eight or nine hours in the air. Completely revolutionary. I loved that project because it was the insight that changed that product to a product that's still in existence today.

Dave (15:32.546)
flat.

Dave (15:44.642)
Hmm. Hmm.

Dave (15:49.347)
Yeah, that's fantastic. I think like, you the combination of the data and the observation just thoroughly underpinning the strategy, right? So there was no question, it sounds like, from inside the business that that was the right thing to do.

Danny Russell - DRC (15:56.867)
Yeah.

Yeah, Yeah, it just, everybody just, it was one of those pieces where everybody, as soon as they heard it and saw it, they were just like, yeah, of course. You're like, why did we not think about this before?

Dave (16:10.442)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It does sound like that was exciting to be there as part of the research team there. Does that particular story hold any lessons for projects today, would you say? Either in the methodology or, yeah, go on.

Danny Russell - DRC (16:15.713)
Yo, it's brilliant. Loved it.

Danny Russell - DRC (16:23.221)
Yes. Yeah, get out from behind the desk and the laptop and go and observe your customers and the pain points that they have. It's as simple as that. I'm genuinely a massive advocate for customer closeness. Get decision makers.

Dave (16:28.97)
Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm. Mm.

Yeah, fantastic.

Danny Russell - DRC (16:48.167)
out of the ivory towers of their offices and the company think where everybody's talking in a very strange language because that's what you do when you're in a big company get out from behind the desk get out from behind the laptop and just go and and and use your product in situ and watch other people in situ and suddenly all that data that is presented to you on it will make sense

Dave (16:57.154)
Hmm. Hmm.

Dave (17:15.758)
Yeah, yeah, fantastic. I think that's such strong and simple advice.

Danny Russell - DRC (17:20.801)
Yeah, it's not, I think sometimes we over complicate. We over complicate. We over complicate as employees in a business, we over complicate things. In ourselves, we're all consumers.

and we all have that moment of customer pain point where it doesn't matter what we're dealing with. You know, whenever you find yourself just going, why do they think that's a good idea? Like, why is that? Why if you're trying to build something out of a pack or you're trying to contact them on the, through their, on a telephone number, if you're trying to deal with them on the website, there's just all these occasions where as consumers ourselves, we sort of...

Dave (17:38.85)
Mm. Mm.

Dave (17:50.862)
Mm.

Dave (17:57.294)
You

Danny Russell - DRC (18:02.145)
the sort of face palm thing and you kind of go, why is that the right thing to do? But on the other side, in the company side, somebody's made that decision, right? Somebody said, we'll do it like this and we'll put the button down here rather than up here. To them, it makes perfect sense. And it's really that closing of the gap between company think and customer think. Great companies have zero gap between that.

Dave (18:04.994)
What were they thinking? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Dave (18:11.884)
Mm-mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (18:31.703)
You know, brilliant experiences are where companies have thought about what the pressure points for the customers are and they fix them. So the customer just goes, great, that was brilliant. Like not only will I use you again, but I'm going to tell everybody else that they should use you. So I think we overcomplicate it and we look to make it sound very technical and advanced and sophisticated. It's not right. There's a lot of simple things that can be fixed.

Dave (18:49.442)
Yeah.

Dave (18:55.118)
It's amazing how simple can sometimes be the hardest thing to do,

Danny Russell - DRC (19:04.984)
Yes.

Dave (19:06.71)
As you look back, what would you say has changed most in research? What's better? What's worse? What's actually harder now?

Danny Russell - DRC (19:16.853)
Right, can we stop so I can refer to notes? Sorry.

Dave (19:19.262)
Yeah, course. No worries, don't, no worries, don't. So this was Cobblest Children's Shoes, stakeholders not always seeing the value, sort of the language of business. So like, you you talk in percentages, we talk money, kind of those sorts of things. Yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (19:35.927)
and the CFO story.

Danny Russell - DRC (19:43.501)
There's also this bit where you said you've said AI isn't just a trend, it's an earthquake. When did that hit you personally? So at some point I have to drop that line in, right?

Dave (19:50.063)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, so that's the next question, actually. That's kind of the AI's impact. So yeah, that will be the subsequent question after we do this segment.

Danny Russell - DRC (19:59.158)
Okay. Yeah, great.

Dave (20:05.292)
Let me know and I'll just roll again. It doesn't matter if we have to do it a couple of times as well.

Danny Russell - DRC (20:10.955)
Everything else okay at the moment? Yeah.

Dave (20:13.238)
Yeah, brilliant, really brilliant. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Danny Russell - DRC (20:17.091)
Okay, so is the... Okay, so you're gonna ask what's changed in research.

Danny Russell - DRC (20:25.473)
Great, okay, far away.

Dave (20:28.119)
Looking back Danny, what's changed most in research? know, what would you say is better? What's worse? Are there things that are actually harder now?

Danny Russell - DRC (20:37.589)
So obviously technology, you know, when I first started, everything was face to face. There was telephone interviewing being done, but most of it was face to face. And of course now very little of it is face to face and technology is really driven new methods, obviously including, including AI, which

you know, is kind of more of an earthquake than a technological shudder. the other thing from my perspective in our sector of insight is that I feel we're under pressure. The IPA Bellwether report is constantly reporting that stakeholders are going to spend less on market research.

and I know of, you know, layoffs and how difficult the market is to find jobs etc. And to a certain extent, I think we as a sector have not done a good job in explaining what it is that we do and why it's valuable. I recall a previous company

my CFO giving me some...

Danny Russell - DRC (22:09.997)
Frank feedback, let's call it, after a debrief, which was, you're not talking our language, you're not talking in financial terms, and whether you like it or not, the company talks in money. And it was...

Dave (22:11.83)
Yep.

Dave (22:24.065)
Okay.

Danny Russell - DRC (22:33.833)
It was at the start of my career at this company and I've always remembered that advice from the CFO. And it's interesting, isn't it, that you tend to see the CEO and the CFO together more than any other combination of C-Suite. It tends to be those two because whether we like it or not, if you're working in the private sector,

obviously there's difference in the public sector, but in the private sector, money talks. And I think as a sector, as an industry, we've not done a great job of clarifying our return on investment. It's a bit like, what's the term, cobbler's shoes. Children's, yeah, cobbler's shoes.

Dave (23:27.906)
Yeah, that's it, Cobbler's Children's Shoes, yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (23:31.44)
I think we all know the story, but I think we're the same. think we're spending, it's ironic really, isn't it? That we're spending a lot of time going into very big companies and talking to them about proposition and about creative consistency and about customer experience and satisfaction, et cetera.

I don't think as a sector we look in on ourselves and think how could we better communicate our proposition because I don't think we talk commercially enough.

Dave (24:06.798)
And do think that researchers are still speaking the wrong language? Is there something fundamentally being missed there?

Danny Russell - DRC (24:15.915)
Honestly, yes, I do. mean not every not all of them but many many I think are still talking too much about purity of methodology and Not enough about Commercial impact and pounds and pence. I think I think when we're together in a room

Dave (24:17.646)
Yeah.

Dave (24:38.734)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (24:45.357)
We're very good at it and we are very energized and we are talking the right language. I just think when the door opens and the financial and the marketing and the advertising guys come in, I think we tend to be a little bit more recessive and quieter.

And I'm very keen for us as a sector to be way louder and way prouder in terms of what we do. because I think if we're not shouting for ourselves, I don't think other people are going to shout for us.

Dave (25:14.328)
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Dave (25:24.206)
Now I love that idea of needing to speak the right language in order for the insights to have the impact that you believe they can have. I think you demonstrated with the British Airways story the impact that it can have when you get the data right, when you get the observation right, and the strategy just becomes completely obvious, and why didn't we think of this before? Do you think that AI can have a large impact here? You just said earlier that it's not just a trend.

Danny Russell - DRC (25:42.999)
Yeah. Yes.

Dave (25:52.383)
AI is more of an earthquake. When did that hit you personally?

Danny Russell - DRC (25:58.116)
So it me personally when, so I have a thing about chatbots. So when I'm...

when I'm dealing with a company who just put layer upon layer of barrier in front of you, it's like they really don't want to talk to you. And I've just got this thing about chatbots, they can basically answer about three questions. And as soon as you go beyond providing your name and address and the product that you've bought, they kind of stumble. And then I had a demonstration.

Dave (26:29.176)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (26:34.751)
from an AI business that had come up with some AI driven text analytics. And I kind of looked at it and thought, it's a chat bot. It's gonna be a bit rubbish, but let me take a look at it.

Dave (26:41.505)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (26:53.251)
And so they ran me through and of course they said amazing things about how the AI was constantly learning and would almost replicate having a conversation with a human. And I fundamentally thought there's no way this is happening. But I'll go ahead with the demonstration. Honestly, completely blew me away. It was absolutely...

Dave (27:17.889)
well.

Danny Russell - DRC (27:20.969)
I thought it was absolutely superb. So it because it was like having I knew it wasn't but it was just like having a conversation with a human being.

Dave (27:23.724)
Why was that?

Danny Russell - DRC (27:32.612)
And that is completely, you know, again, I talked earlier about sort of customer thinking, company thinking. think too many customers just, sorry, too many companies think, let's whack a chat bot up onto the website because then people will kind of, it'll answer some questions and then people will basically go away. But from a customer perspective,

Dave (27:44.088)
Mm. Mm.

Yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (27:53.642)
I really just want to talk to somebody. If I've got to the stage where I'm accessing a chat bot on a website, it's primarily because I've got an issue. Because we've all got far too much to do than just sit around going, let me just go online and talk to a chat bot for a laugh. I've got an issue and I desperately want to talk to somebody. This demonstration that I was giving of this AI text analytics tool.

was it was like talking to a person and so what I did was I started just using some slang words in there just to see if I could trip it up and it answered it just like a human being would do. It would pick out the slang and just go let me just check what you mean by the slang

Dave (28:29.134)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Dave (28:44.332)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (28:45.437)
Do you mean this or do you mean that? And it is in exactly the same way as a human being would. And that for me was a real wake-up call. And I remember kind of being massively impressed and terrified at exactly the same time. It was mixed emotions.

Dave (28:52.28)
Amazing.

Mm.

Dave (29:02.686)
equal measure. Brilliant. And how would you say that that feeling was sort of compared to know Dawn of the Internet or cloud or kind of mobile as each of those technologies have shifted?

Danny Russell - DRC (29:12.865)
So I think, yeah, look, they've all had a big impact. I think there's two slight differences with AI. I think the speed of technological improvement in AI has been dramatic. I remember...

I remember when the internet was a thing. was at British Airways and somebody sat us all down and talked to us about what the internet was. And we were all just a bit sort of sceptical. And of course it took an awful long time to get anywhere to where it was here. I remember somebody saying, you know, travel agents will be no more because people will come online to book their travel. And of course this was when there was three travel agents in every high street. So of course we were just like, that's not going

And here we are today, it's like trying to find a travel agent, a retail travel agent somewhere. With AI, the speed of that technological adoption and innovation has just been incredibly quick. And to the example I've given around the AI chat bot, let's call it, it does feel like the replacement of humans.

Dave (30:10.496)
You

Danny Russell - DRC (30:34.569)
And so I think that's why I sort of say it's tremendously exciting and terrifying at the same time, because it is like, where does this stop? How smart will this become? And I'm often, you know, we get into that whole debate about AI and will it replace people's jobs, et cetera? And there's...

I want to make sure I get her name right. Her name is, she's an author, Joanna Masyjewska. Joanna Masyjewska. And people have probably heard it, but she was the one that said, what I want AI to do is my laundry and my dishes so that I can go out and do all the creative things. Not for AI.

to do all the creative things so that I can continue to do my laundry and my dishes. And I think of all the stuff that I hear around AI, the theory and I think the hope is that AI will do the treacherous stuff within our sector. So writing questionnaires, discussion guides, really speeding up the analysis.

Dave (31:51.214)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (32:02.579)
I just hope that stakeholders within the business don't decide to let us carry on doing the laundry and the ironing and the dishes.

and they get AI to do all the sexy stuff. So I think it's a watch out. I like to be try and think positively and optimistically about it. But I do think we have to be careful if stakeholders have barriers to approaching their insight teams and they run off and just use AI without any human involvement at all, because we all know the risks of what that will look like.

Dave (32:41.71)
Yeah, totally agree. I think there's a big risk of people not applying the human insight, the human strategy layer over the top of it. If you could wave a magic wand and reinvent the research process or something about the industry itself, what is it that you'd change?

Danny Russell - DRC (32:54.007)
Yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (33:04.387)
just gonna pause again, sorry Dave. Where are your notes? Because you're looking very professional there, whereas I'm looking all over the place. Are your notes attached just below the screen?

Dave (33:06.06)
That's all right. We were thinking of.

Dave (33:13.578)
Yes, I just put them yeah, I put them right right next to my yeah at the top of my screen So it's right next to where the little camera thing is Well, yeah, it's amazing what that the I think what gets lost often with all of these sorts of tools is is the eye contact And I think that's what people have almost got you too used to it now and they used to just sort of looking around everywhere But like on a video that's actually really is this good slight. It's just you just done

Danny Russell - DRC (33:19.383)
Very good. See, you're a professional at that.

Danny Russell - DRC (33:30.594)
Yes.

Danny Russell - DRC (33:35.34)
Yeah, yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (33:39.841)
Yeah, and you're very good at it because you're further, you're far enough away you've got your notes that it hardly looks as it looks as if you're all doing it from memory. Right, okay, so this is the Logic Wand. so.

Dave (33:40.066)
get the same engagement I

Dave (33:48.438)
Listen now.

Dave (33:59.855)
Yeah, I think this bit is brilliant because this is about spending huge amounts on the launch and often researchers just get abandoned post debrief.

Danny Russell - DRC (34:10.401)
Yeah, okay.

I've got to keep these on there, haven't I? Yeah, okay, great. Sorry, guys. Continuity.

Dave (34:13.582)
cool, that's alright, yeah that's a good catch. So Danny, if you could wave a magic wand and reinvent the research process or something about the industry itself, what do think it is that you would change?

Danny Russell - DRC (34:32.628)
I would place far more importance on the post-debrief activity.

I think, so lots of people now are talking about insight to impact. So I think we've done a pretty good job in terms of the methodologies. Again, we've talked about technology and the use that technology can be put to in order to make things the holy trinity of faster, better, cheaper. And I think we've made great strides on that. I think as a sector.

Dave (35:07.854)
You

Danny Russell - DRC (35:13.025)
the thing that we're not good at is communicating those insights through to actually having that final impact. And I think there was a great question asked at an SMR conference a couple of years ago when somebody in the audience said to a client panel, how much, percentage of your research budget is allocated to post debrief activity?

and there was a lot of people looking at their shoes and shuffling awkwardly in their seats and they tended to fluff the lines but you could tell not a lot and I liken it to Hollywood and the film industry which is they spend an awful lot of money and time filming the movie

Dave (35:53.678)
Mm-hmm. Yep.

Dave (36:10.734)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Danny Russell - DRC (36:12.451)
but they don't then just launch the movie and forget about it. Whereas in the research sector I think we spend all our time and effort on making the movie and then we have this one debrief and everybody comes to the debrief and then that's it and they all wander out and then we assume that the insight has landed and that the stakeholders who were at the debrief will go away and do something with it.

Dave (36:21.952)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (36:39.639)
Hollywood doesn't do that, of course.

first of all makes a huge fuss of the debrief so a launch night in Leicester Square Barbie for example you know double decker buses are pink the floors pink everything's pink the stars turn up the light bulbs are flashing etc it's a very very big deal and you know about it but then of course the constant advertising of Barbie the movie and I don't think as a sector

Dave (36:47.02)
Mm-hmm.

Dave (37:04.27)
Mm-hmm.

Danny Russell - DRC (37:12.543)
do do enough in terms of the post debrief activity? I think there's a feeling that once we've given the insight to the stakeholders, they will take it on. I'm doing some work at the moment around an initiative called customer saliency, which is the extent to which your internal stakeholders have the customer in mind when they're out and about making all these decisions, which could be

Dave (37:22.37)
Hmm. Hmm.

Dave (37:35.022)
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

Danny Russell - DRC (37:42.466)
two three four five months

after the debrief. To what extent is that insight implanted in their brain and means enough to them so that when they are making the decision about where the button goes on the website or which retail outlets they're going to use or what price they're going to charge, are they thinking customer think or are they thinking company think? Because all these stakeholders have their own KPIs, they've got their own pressures, they're all dealing with life.

Dave (38:11.916)
Hmm. Hmm.

Danny Russell - DRC (38:14.819)
I just think we have to help them ensure that we've landed that insight time and time again so it just becomes a truth within the organisation. That I think is a huge challenge for us.

Dave (38:26.254)
I love that idea, that idea of, yeah, absolutely. I love that idea of it, of needing to get it embedded, as I remember that movie from a while ago, but it's called Inception, where that idea has to be so deeply implanted that they really believe it and live it. And I think what you're saying there is that in order for the insights to have that level of impact, that communication has to work so effectively that those ideas and those concepts of understanding the customer fundamentally.

Danny Russell - DRC (38:41.835)
Yes. Yeah.

Dave (38:55.896)
just get embedded to that degree. think that's fantastic insight in and of itself. Is that what sort of research ops is trying to address, do you think? Or is the problem kind of deeper than that?

Danny Russell - DRC (39:01.026)
Yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (39:07.427)
Yeah, think it is. But I think it's more than just sort of tooling. I think this is a bit of a positioning problem that we have. And going back to what I saying earlier, I think it's in that realm of out of sight, out of mind.

Dave (39:16.045)
Mm-hmm.

Dave (39:35.022)
Yep.

Danny Russell - DRC (39:36.352)
So just thinking about what we were just talking about, so customer salience, about getting it implanted there. I do think there's an extra challenge now, which is in this hybrid world, it's a lot easier to be out of sight, out of mind.

Dave (39:52.523)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (39:54.02)
you know, getting people together to debriefs is physically being there is more difficult in the hybrid world. But also, I just think back to pre-COVID and the importance of those corridor conversations, you know, the number of times, Sky was a huge organization and the one place...

that everybody from across the organisation, whether they be in Sky News or Sky Movies or Sky Sports or Creative or Marketing or Finance, the one place they used to meet up was in the canteen. Because there was one canteen and everybody would go there at some point during the day to get food. The number of times you'd walk into the canteen and see...

Dave (40:31.566)
Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (40:43.265)
Jennifer from Sky Sports and you'd be able to just wander over to Jennifer and Sorry to interrupt Jennifer. You know, we were going to talk about X Well, I've emailed you four times now and you've not come back. Is there a problem? What should we do about it? And it was just having that face-to-face Contact was so Crucial and so important

Dave (41:02.616)
Yep. Yep.

Dave (41:07.31)
ability to show up at the right time kind of thing.

Danny Russell - DRC (41:09.667)
Yeah, it's kind of, you when we're thinking about, if you're thinking about the classic four P's of marketing, is that place aspect of being in the same place at the same time, I think is somewhat overlooked. I remember an agency saying to me,

Dave (41:16.832)
Mm. Mm. Mm.

Dave (41:24.214)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (41:31.204)
2022 so it's kind of halfway through Covid and he was saying that the 10 minute walk between the boardroom where we'd had the debrief and me taking them down to reception to sort of sign them out and get them properly off the building.

I remember him saying to me those 10 minutes were just the best 10 minutes ever because it was our time to download what we'd heard in the debrief, whether it gone well, what the next steps were, what the missing outcome was. And interestingly from his perspective, from the agency perspective, that was when he was plugging me in terms of the next steps in terms of more work, which he did very skillfully because I didn't see it as a

cell but he would he would be saying you know Mr. X in the in the back he asked about A, B and C we can do that shall I pull you shall I pull you some thoughts together in terms of how we could answer Mr. X's question around A, B and C and of course I would say yeah brilliant that would be that would be great so and I think again in that hybrid world I think sometimes we've lost a little bit of that human interaction.

Dave (42:51.214)
Yeah, you're sort of saying there's real value in that less formal space and those kind of more candid interactions and that's some of what's been lost. Thinking back across your career, what would you say is the best work advice that you've ever received?

Danny Russell - DRC (43:00.449)
Yeah. Yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (43:10.211)
Definitely that the story I told around the Chief Financial Officer just saying to me in terms of you're not talking the right language here.

Dave (43:21.23)
And if you want your insights to have an impact, suppose, you need to be speaking the language of the person.

Danny Russell - DRC (43:24.981)
Yeah, get some numbers, get numbers in there, numbers from a financial perspective, not just percentages. Like you can present a very small percentage, it might be huge in terms of money, and you put it into those financial terms and people will sit up and take notice. Again, in the private sector,

Dave (43:37.176)
Mm-hmm.

Dave (43:42.912)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (43:52.984)
for profit-making companies, but that is the vast, vast majority, right? I know this will be different for public sector and social research, et cetera, yeah, that's the advice that's stuck with me all the time, which is, and we do talk about it. We talk about the so what.

Dave (44:12.162)
Hmm. Hmm.

Danny Russell - DRC (44:12.557)
We talk about the so what, but often the so what we tend to embed in yet more percentages. If we can turn that so what into a financial number.

Dave (44:18.434)
Hmm.

Dave (44:23.395)
Mm-hmm.

Danny Russell - DRC (44:23.689)
then that becomes all important. What I was saying earlier around the stakeholders around the business have all got their own pressures and they've all got their own challenges. They'll quite often be financial pressure. If you're talking to a stakeholder over in Sky Sports or over in the catering team at British Airways, often...

What's keeping them awake at night is some sort of financial issue in their budgets that they are behind on or overspending on or whatever. Talking to them about...

percentage of the population that do X, Y and Z, we're at slightly different odds. We're talking slightly different languages. As soon as you can revert into their language and kind of get onto the treadmill of the way that they're thinking, then suddenly you start to get a lot closer together and they will definitely want your help.

Dave (45:20.782)
Brilliant. Thank you so much. We're just coming to the end of our time today. If there's one thing that you'd like listeners to take away from this conversation, what would it be?

Danny Russell - DRC (45:31.821)
Sorry, one more pause.

Dave (45:32.814)
It's alright. It's not just about knowing things, it's about making the change happen. Mark it ourselves, speak commercially, only out.

Danny Russell - DRC (45:36.823)
Yeah.

Big commercially only outcome if we don't AIS each week.

Dave (45:46.383)
Yeah, think there's a stark warning. So Danny, thank you so much for our conversation today. It's been really, really insightful. If there's one thing you'd like listeners to take away from our conversation, what would it be?

Danny Russell - DRC (45:48.066)
Yeah.

Danny Russell - DRC (46:01.13)
Let's get more commercial. Okay, so let's start talking in finances. Let's start being more attuned to the way most businesses think from a financial perspective. Let's not get too bogged down in the purity of the methodology because if we don't start to speak that language,

and become faster, better, cheaper, then I'm afraid, as we've also talked about, AI will do that for us.

I don't think the C-suite are sitting there worrying too much about the purity of the methodology when they've got a lot of people coming to them telling them that AI can do this just as well. You know, we have to start adding some of that human value. And that for me is around sort of that understanding.

understanding what the insight does from an impact perspective in the business as opposed to just delivering the insight and hoping that in some way it'll stick.

Dave (47:07.49)
Mm. Mm.

Dave (47:13.454)
So taking ownership of that outcome, I really love that about what you're saying there. It's kind of impact driven by the insights but actually taking ownership of where it goes next and what happens next.

Danny Russell - DRC (47:25.281)
Yeah, so if you've delivered the insight and your stakeholders aren't taking that seriously, then you take it seriously yourself. Own that insight and...

Dave (47:33.718)
Mm. Mm.

Danny Russell - DRC (47:36.055)
go out into that business and deliver that insight time and time and time again. Just become the insight annoyance around the business. So keep telling them what it is their customers need. It's a fantastic time to be in insight because it's a confusing time for businesses. We've got what's going on with tariffs. There's lots and lots of confusion. There's a lot of

Dave (47:47.786)
You

Danny Russell - DRC (48:06.005)
There's a lot of extra information being pumped out, but still a human brain trying to calculate what to do with it. We can actually lessen that confusion and become the arbiters of what the customer really wants. But we have to get out there and do that. Again, I mentioned earlier about get out from behind your desk and behind your laptop. Go out there and live it. And we can own the outcome.

Dave (48:09.326)
Hmm.

Dave (48:30.99)
Brilliant. Well, thank you so much, Danny. I really appreciate you taking the time to take part in this conversation this afternoon. Thank you.

Danny Russell - DRC (48:38.563)
No problems. Thank you, Dave. Much appreciated. I enjoyed it.

Dave (48:42.446)
Perfect. All right, wonderful. That was really good. Really, really good. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely fantastic. No, no, not at all. I think that was really, really good. That was really...

Danny Russell - DRC (48:46.165)
Okay? Good. Anything else we need to go over again? I screwed up.
