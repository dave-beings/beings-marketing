## Persona \- Decision-maker 

### **ICP: The Decision-Maker**

**Persona: Alex Chen, Managing Director / Head of Insights**

**Demographics:**

* **Age:** 40-55  
* **Location:** London, with a national or international client base.  
* **Education:** Master's degree in a relevant field (e.g., Business, Marketing, Social Sciences) or has learned through extensive industry experience.  
* **Experience:** 15+ years in the insights industry. Likely started as a hands-on researcher ("was a Sarah Lee") before moving into leadership.

**Role & Responsibilities:**

* **P\&L Ownership:** Directly responsible for the agency's revenue, profitability, and growth. Manages budgets and resource allocation.  
* **Team Leadership:** Manages and mentors the research team, including the "Sarah Lees." Responsible for hiring, retention, and team morale.  
* **Strategic Direction:** Sets the agency's vision. Decides which new services to offer, which markets to enter, and how to position the agency against competitors.  
* **Client Relationship Management:** Handles the most senior client relationships, pitches for high-value projects, and is the final point of escalation for any issues.  
* **Operational Excellence:** Constantly looking for ways to improve processes, increase efficiency, and ensure the quality of the agency's output is consistently high.

**Goals & Challenges:**

| Goal | Corresponding Challenge (Their Internal Monologue) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Increase Profit Margins** | "My team is spending too much non-billable time on manual admin like transcription and formatting. We're busy, but are we as profitable as we should be?" |
| **Win More Business** | "We're losing pitches to agencies that look more modern and have a slicker 'tech story'. How do we differentiate beyond just 'we have smart people'?" |
| **Grow the Business (Scale)** | "We're at capacity. I can't take on that big new client without hiring more people, which is slow and expensive. How can I increase my team's throughput?" |
| **Retain Top Talent** | "Good researchers are hard to find. Sarah is brilliant, but she's getting burned out. I need to give my team tools that make their job more enjoyable, not more frustrating." |
| **De-risk the Business** | "One bad project or a client data issue could really damage our reputation. I need our processes to be robust, secure, and compliant." |

**Frustrations & Pain Points:**

* **The "Feast or Famine" Cycle:** The stress of managing project pipelines and resource allocation is immense.  
* **Inconsistent Quality:** Worries that as the team gets busier, the quality of insight and client-facing reports might slip.  
* **Tech Debt:** Knows the agency's current mix of tools (e.g., separate tools for transcription, video calls, analysis) is clunky and inefficient but fears the cost and hassle of making a change.  
* **Proving ROI to Clients:** Constantly needs to justify the cost of high-quality research against cheaper, faster alternatives that clients might be considering.

**Motivations & Values:**

* **Reputation & Pride:** Deeply proud of the agency's reputation for delivering quality work and insightful thinking.  
* **Commercial Pragmatism:** Is motivated by solutions that have a clear and demonstrable impact on the bottom line.  
* **Legacy & Growth:** Wants to build a sustainable, respected agency that can thrive in the future.  
* **Trust & Partnership:** Values long-term relationships, both with clients and with vendors who act like partners, not just suppliers.

**Technology Adoption:**

* **Cautious but Curious Adopter:** Unlike Sarah (the early adopter), Alex is more pragmatic. They won't jump on a trend but will invest decisively once they see a clear business case.  
* **Seeks ROI and Integration:** Asks questions like: "How will this reduce our project costs?", "How does it fit with the tools we already use?", "How quickly can my team learn it?".  
* **Influenced by Peer Success:** Seeing a direct competitor or a respected peer agency adopt and succeed with a new tool is a massive trigger. They pay close attention to the "Keeping up with the Joneses" mentality.
