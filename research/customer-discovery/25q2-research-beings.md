Study invite:
Hello ___,
[Intro by Dave or Khadeeja]:
My name is Khadeeja and I‚Äôm a researcher with over 5 years of experience in mixed-methods and qualitative research. I am undertaking a project to assess the ways in which AI can aid the processes involved in qualitative research. This work is in collaboration with Beings.com - a powerful AI-based platform centralising research tools such as interview recording, transcription, and assisted analysis. 

I am reaching out because of your expertise and experience in qualitative research methodologies. Over the next few weeks, I am aiming to interview about 10-12 experts to gauge the usefulness of the Beings.com platform and identify use cases for it. We intend to use the findings from this study to demonstrate the capabilities of Beings.com. As such, if you are willing to participate in the study, we would ask for your consent to use data from your interview in demo videos for the platform.

If you are interested in this study, please complete the brief pre-screening form linked here, after which you will be contacted by one of our team members. If you have questions you would like answered prior to agreeing to participate, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. 

I hope to hear back from you soon,
Khadeeja Ahmed
