 Speaker 1 (2:22 - 2:22): 
Hi. 
 Speaker 2 (2:24 - 2:25): 
Hi, how are you? 
 Speaker 1 (2:25 - 2:27): 
I'm very well, thank you. How are you? Good to meet you. 
 Speaker 2 (2:28 - 2:31): 
Yeah, good to meet you as well. Yeah, I'm doing good. 
 Speaker 1 (2:32 - 2:55): 
Excellent. Excellent. Um, looking forward to hearing all about how you've been getting on and, uh, seeing you, how I can help you guys. Uh, I just had a, a note from Ben said he was stuck in a, a consultation so he's not able to join. Um, Rida. I've already gone through quite a lot of the stuff with, um, with Rida, so I dunno if she's planning to join again or not. She has accepted the invite, but we'll wait and see. And then there's And Sash, 
 Speaker 2 (2:56 - 2:56): 
Yeah, 
 Speaker 1 (2:57 - 2:58): 
Dunno about them 
 Speaker 2 (2:59 - 3:05): 
Potentially as well. Um, I'll see if they're able to join. 
 Speaker 1 (3:06 - 3:08): 
Yeah, we can give 'em a few minutes. It's 
 Speaker 2 (3:08 - 3:41): 
Now Yeah, might be. 'cause it's Google Meet as well. We're normally on teams, so, yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (3:41 - 3:45): 
Sorry about that. It's real pain, isn't it? Jumping through all these different 
 Speaker 2 (3:45 - 3:46): 
Systems. [laugh], 
 Speaker 1 (3:51 - 3:54): 
While we're waiting, why don't you, um, tell me a little bit about yourself, Yasmin. 
 Speaker 2 (3:55 - 4:07): 
Well, um, yeah, I'm actually quite new to Wrangle. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, and I've never used beings before either, so double whammy. Yeah. Um, I used 
 Speaker 1 (4:07 - 4:09): 
To work. Have you used many other tools? 
 Speaker 2 (4:10 - 4:21): 
Um, not really. I'm normally more, um, quants, um, leaning. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, I'm sure obviously beings applies to that as well, but Yeah, 
 Speaker 1 (4:22 - 4:56): 
Not, yeah, actually we're super focused on the qual, like there's so many quant platforms out there, um, that we kind of decided when we got into this a couple of years ago to really focus on the, the conversational stuff, really focused on the, the qu side. Um, and so that's, yeah, we, I think quite likely to add quant stuff in future. Um, but at the moment we're trying to look at finding ways to, uh, to structure the data that's collected through conversation, um, and often quantify. So quantify the qual [laugh]. Um, but, uh, but yeah, really that's, that's the focus at the moment. Where, what were you doing before? Where were you before? 
 Speaker 2 (4:56 - 5:01): 
Um, yeah, before I was at Reuters and then before that. Ipsos. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (5:01 - 5:02): 
Okay. Nice. Cool. 
 Speaker 2 (5:02 - 5:02): 
Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (5:03 - 5:12): 
What's it, what was it like? Um, I guess, so you've, so you've come out of like a massive or a couple of massive organizations right into how many people at Quad Rankl? It's, it's a bit, it's a lot smaller. 
 Speaker 2 (5:12 - 5:16): 
20. Yeah. And total 20. Around 20. Yeah. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (5:16 - 5:21): 
Cool. Perfect. So totally different culture I guess from that perspective. Yeah. Yeah. 
 Speaker 2 (5:21 - 5:26): 
Cool. Yeah, I've never worked in a small business, so it's been quite nice, actually. A nice difference. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (5:27 - 5:29): 
Amazing. A bit less process, I bet. 
 Speaker 2 (5:30 - 5:37): 
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Like [inaudible] is very like process heavy. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Yeah. What about you? What's your backgrounds? 
 Speaker 1 (5:37 - 6:21): 
So, I'm a technologist. Um, I actually started out, uh, founding a business that does, um, broadcasting and live streaming equipment rental. Um, which is obviously a bit random and unrelated to research. Um, but we got involved. Um, uh, so yeah, so I've, I've not been in that business in 2015. My, actually, my brother runs that one. Um, and I was looking to start a software business and looking in the world of ai and actually we'd done a lot of work with Google, um, and we were introduced to their research team. Um, and they were looking for video solutions to use as part of their usability testing. They do a huge amount of usability testing, um, which is, you know, not massively dissimilar from, from qual. It's just got, you know, a specific application. Um, they want to understand how their customers are using their products and services. 
 Speaker 1 (6:21 - 7:11): 
Um, so we kinda got dragged into it that way. Um, and then just kind of fed in love with the research space, like, just love the fact that people are trying to make things better, you know, they wanna understand stuff and work out how to improve things and yeah, just love that. So, um, started beings, um, January, 2023. Um, and, uh, yeah, just learning as much as I can, as, as fast as I can, um, from, from all the researchers that we get to work with. So, so yeah, I'm a complete novice really. I try to, um, so I guess listen to the way that you guys use the product and understand like what's working, what's not working, like, and then try to just also always ask like, is there something else, like in your work day or work life that's just always so difficult in qual or time consuming that, that we could do next to sort of build it into the platform. So, um, yeah, it's, it's early days for us for a little startup. 
 Speaker 2 (7:13 - 7:36): 
It's good. Start there. It was like when I saw the platform I was like, this is actually so useful. Yeah. You can see your potential. Cool. Yeah. 'cause I mean it takes hours for researchers to analyze, call interviews and then just being able to ask it questions and it just give you the response. Like find key quotes, things like that was really useful. Cool. Um, yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (7:37 - 7:41): 
Yeah. Anything that was awful. Was there anything when you first used, you're like, what the hell is this [laugh]? 
 Speaker 2 (7:43 - 7:48): 
Um, no, it was quite clear in terms of like his design and everything. Okay. 
 Speaker 1 (7:48 - 7:54): 
Um, thought the layout kind of made sense broadly. Like now you can tell I'm doing a bit of, do the research on you, [laugh] 
 Speaker 2 (7:56 - 8:10): 
The layout makes sense to me personally. Yeah. Um, I think it's just getting used to like, which prompts to like, like the prompts to give it basically to get what you need. Yeah. But yeah, my colleagues as well, they knew a bit more about it, so. 
 Speaker 1 (8:10 - 8:36): 
Cool. Cool. Great. Um, yeah, Ben was just telling me yesterday he did, he'd just uploaded a whole nother project or something, um, yesterday and started kind of querying some, some bits and pieces and we just sort of mm-Hmm, [affirmative] added an additional kind of upgraded model option on advanced mode, um, just this week. So I don't know, you may not have had a chance to, when, when have you been, when have you been using it? If you don't mind me asking? Like, over the last couple of weeks or? 
 Speaker 2 (8:36 - 8:41): 
Yeah, it would've been mainly like towards the end of like last week. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (8:41 - 9:27): 
Cool. Yeah. Yeah. So this week we just added this little toggle that gives you an advanced mode, um, which you'll find. I ho well I hope you find that, like, you don't necessarily feel like you always want that, but some, 'cause it takes a bit longer just to sort of think about it a bit more. Um, but I think for certain types of, um, analysis that you might be trying to do, you might find that that's sort of super useful. And I'm really interested just to understand like through the qual process, are there certain sorts of things that one is more suitable rather than the other? And then we can help kind of build guides into the system because we've not really done any kind of how to guides yet or anything, but I think maybe trying to build some of that into the system might help. Um, uh, so yeah, like what, what would you say was your, um, kind of biggest frustration? Is it really just around the prompting? Was there anything else that you wanna cover today? 
 Speaker 2 (9:29 - 9:43): 
Yeah, I would say for, I mean, and the other researchers as well, it seemed to be the prompts and then sometimes of the quotes, it would, um, say it was from one person, but it was from someone else or something like that. Okay. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (9:44 - 10:25): 
Yeah. So we're going through quite a big project at the moment. It's gonna run for the next two or three months. Um, and it's called grounding and it, it's just a technical way in which we can sort of loop back and validate, um, those, those responses. Um, because yeah, with all the different sources, um, you know, ends up actually with tens and tens and it's not hundreds of thousands of words that it's trying to analyze. And so yeah, the attribution or essentially we're gonna add citations into the system, so whenever it tells you something like that, you'll better just click the citation and it will take you, um, to that point in the video. Um, and so you can just sort of scroll back and forward a bit and understand the, the context slightly better. Um, which I hope will just help build trust as well. 
 Speaker 1 (10:25 - 11:09): 
I think one of the big challenges with AI is people like, they know that they can hallucinate, they kind of wanna make sure they can trust it. So we're just trying to build as many kind of trust and transparency, um, uh, sort of systems into the platform. So you can always just check and verify and check and verify and feel comfortable and confident. Um, cool. Really useful. Um, so I've got like a couple of documents. Um, I've got one which is kind of basic prompting, one that's a bit more advanced prompting. Um, why don't we kind of jump get into those. Um, I'd love to sort of, um, if you're happy, just like screen share, like, so RID had added me to the, um, it's JN 1 3 8, 6 4, the LBG Health project. Is that the one that you've been working on as well or have you been working on something different? I 
 Speaker 2 (11:09 - 11:10): 
Think that's the one, yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (11:11 - 12:00): 
Cool. Um, so I was gonna ask if you wanted just to like maybe screen share and sort of walk through, like, almost do like a think out loud style of study. So as you're kind of going through, just explain to me what you would be doing in the, in the, through your analysis and sort of we can then look at how you're prompting or how that maps onto the prompting, if that makes sense. Um, so let me start with a brief overview. I'll just share these couple of docs first, um, that I put together for, uh, RID and Ben. So, um, [inaudible], um, so yeah, just kind of a, a way of kind of thinking about it is, you know, think about the AI as a bit of a junior research. You've gotta be relatively strict and focused, um, with, uh, with how you're constructing your prompts. 
 Speaker 1 (12:00 - 12:44): 
So you can't just sort of say, gimme a summary, um, or you can, but it's a little bit too open-ended actually the way to get a better quality responses think in terms of these kind of four Cs. So, um, giving it a bit of context, um, you need to kind of set the scene. So instead of saying summarize this, you could say this is an interview transcript with a long-term member of the company health plan. Our goal is to understand the drivers. So setting up that context and that goal. Um, the sec, so that's context. The second C is, is clarity. Um, so just trying to be quite specific. Um, again, instead of sort of tell me of some themes or tell me some topics or whatever, just sort of list the top five frustrations mentioned in this transcript related to the service process or whatever it is that you're trying to understand. 
 Speaker 1 (12:45 - 13:29): 
And then, you know, focus specifically on bureaucracy, communication and approvals or, you know, whatever it is that's relevant to that, to the, um, analysis at that point. Um, so again, that, that clarity that comes from being a bit more specific, um, give it some constraints 'cause otherwise it really can sort of go off and sort of come up with all sorts of things. Um, so again, just when you're thinking about putting that prompt together, like just constrain it. So rather than what the key points, you know, give me three direct quotes about, and again, within that kind of, in terms of what you might say with the about, you might then link that back to the, the, the, the specific clarity points. Um, and then you can say to it like, give me it in a table, or you can say to it, just give me it as, um, a bullet point list or you can say to it, like, put it like, show me as a quote. 
 Speaker 1 (13:29 - 14:12): 
Um, you can ask it for details. So you can say like, alongside its participant ID or alongside, um, the piece of context name. So, um, in the UI, if you selected two or three um, bits of context, you can just ask it to be, be specific in that way. Um, and then the fourth C is just, is converse. Um, so once you've given it that little bit kind of, uh, Ben messaged me earlier and he said that he started saying thank you today, and he noticed that it would then, it was almost like it was being nicer back to him as well. [laugh] really? And he, yeah, and he felt like, 'cause it was almost encouraging conversation and so it was almost prompting him to think stuff, which he would then sort of go back with. But just randomly he was like, I'm pretty sure that when I'm nice to it, ADA does actually give me more [laugh]. 
 Speaker 1 (14:12 - 15:00): 
Um, so that's quite funny as well. Um, so yeah, rather than just kind of, uh, the example here is what process fun, uh, frustrations are mentioned in this transcript. You can say like, that's a key finding. Can you expand on that point about, and then be specific again about that point that it may have said so that you can expand on it. Does that make sense? So, um, just to go back through those, the four Cs context, clarity, constraint, and then conversation. Just, just feel free to chat back and forth with it. Um, and then I guess I wanted to go through, um, uh, I guess one of the key limitations of the current technology, um, which we are working on, but it's gonna take us probably three to six months, um, is it has what's called like a context window. So it can only review a certain number of words in one go. 
 Speaker 1 (15:00 - 15:48): 
So for example, if you were to try right now and select all the transcripts, it would just follow, but it, like, it would come back with nonsense basically. Um, and so it, it, it's not a perfect thing, but between about 15,000 and 20,000 words is about the limit. Um, and so what I've been saying to some of the others is like, uh, that just requires you to think a little bit about how to get the most of it and almost to build up layers of, of information. So you might ask about one specific script, or, or maybe you've got six people in a cohort. You might go through each of those individually and create notes for each of those individual ones first. That might, they might be quite long. They might be sort of, you know, 5,000, 10,000 words, whatever they happen to be. Um, they can be quite detailed, but then you can kind of, um, transfer those notes back into your sources. 
 Speaker 1 (15:48 - 16:30): 
And then that can kind of, you can ask it to create a summary for cohort one, those six people. So you can sort of build up these layers, um, of, uh, of themes of topics of, of whatever type of analysis you're trying to do. And then that way you can sort of start to compare and contrast across the different, um, uh, across the different people in a cohort, or even if you've got up middle layer again across different cohorts, as long as you've sort of stepped up in, in stages, um, as you're thinking about the analysis. Any questions on that that doesn't, it just, that sort of makes sense. Like I, what I'm really interested in a minute is for you to kind of screen share, talk me through a bit like how you were kind of coming at it. And I wanna just understand how that does or doesn't map onto sort of your, how you're thinking about it. 
 Speaker 1 (16:31 - 17:13): 
Um, and yeah, there's just some other useful stuff. Like if you, one of our ideas is that in future you guys can record some of your internal meetings. You can upload like the briefing documents and all of that, and then sort of ask it to help you build discussion guides and you sort of use it to kind of stress test, um, you know, bias within your discussion guides, things like that. Um, so I've just got a little hint of that later. Um, and then I probably won't go through this one right now, but I'll send this one to you afterwards. You can just go through it. This was specifically in relation to this, um, project based on the limited information I kind of had at it as, um, as you guys were starting. Um, but it just, it just goes into that kind of phased approach, um, in a little bit more detail. 
 Speaker 1 (17:13 - 17:56): 
So it was a way of a way of structuring like how you're capturing those insights. Um, so that idea of you, you might be looking at emotion, emotion and sentiment. You might be looking at sort of profiling the participants first. You can sort of look at these different things and create these kind of subgroups within notes. And then once they're in your notes, you can send them back to the left hand side, send them back to, to become sources and then run more analysis on them again. So that I, that concept of, of looping round and round, um, is, uh, is, is super useful. Um, so yeah, I'll let you kind of go through that a little bit more sort of on your own time. Um, and feel free to email me with any questions or once you've tried anything, just sort of say, Hey Dave, this doesn't make sense, or this does [laugh] 
 Speaker 2 (17:57 - 17:57): 
[laugh]. 
 Speaker 1 (17:57 - 18:57): 
Cool. Uh, so I'll leave it there for now. Um, why don't you screen share if you, if you're happy to. Um, so in the middle there's a little share screen button with a little upwards arrow. If you click that one, it'll then ask you to share a window, I think. Um, so then if you share your browser window. Yeah. Cool. Perfect. Um, f and then just to let you know, um, there's a little at the top, very top right hand side, there's a little settings cog. Um, if you prefer light mode or dark mode, you can just kind of select that there, um, different people have different preferences, um, just so you're aware there's some sort of comfort options there. Um, so yeah, why don't you talk me through, um, uh, yeah, your sort of involvement in the project first. So, um, I'd love to know like, when did you join the project? Did you join at the discovery phase or the kind of planning phase or the kind of, um, you know, data collection phase or just the analysis phase? Like just talk me through a little bit about, um, about your role in the project. 
 Speaker 2 (18:58 - 19:19): 
So my role in the project was quite new, so literally since last week. Um, and then yeah, in the analysis stage, so going on here mm-hmm, [affirmative] and picking out like key quotes to include and like the report for the client Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] of the different kind of groups that we have in the sample. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, so that was my main role and that was the main thing I used beings for. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (19:19 - 19:27): 
Fabulous. And did, what materials were you given in order for you to be able to understand the project? Like what Yeah, how were you briefed? How did that come about? 
 Speaker 2 (19:28 - 19:41): 
Um, I had a call with the rest of the team members. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] and then kind of went through the report as it was and the different concepts they're testing. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So that was the main, main thing that they kind of did. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (19:41 - 19:51): 
Great. So it was mostly discussion based. Did you have much materials like any PowerPoints or PDFs or sort of Word documents that you also kind of referred to, to sort of build up your initial understanding of the project? 
 Speaker 2 (19:52 - 19:58): 
Um, just the PowerPoint. Yeah, just the report with the initial findings. So yeah. Quite fresh. 
 Speaker 1 (19:58 - 20:54): 
Yeah. Yeah. Cool. No, it's, yeah, it's nice to come, come to something fresh like that, isn't it? Um, we don't actually do PowerPoints yet, but like you can PDFA PowerPoint and then we can upload a PDF and you can ask Ada questions about the PDF as well if you just want to kind of, um, play with, um, with how you, you know, user as a research partner bouncing ideas around. Um, at the moment, like none of your chat history is, is stored anywhere, so it doesn't save anything at all. So you can feel comfortable and confident that you can ask it anything you like, nothing's being un of tracked or monitored or, um, anything, uh, in that sort of way, like we have been asked by a few customers like, oh, we'd love to be able to save chat histories. And so we might introduce that as an option. But the moment, just from a data privacy perspective, it's much simpler for everybody if we don't store any of that information. Um, so, uh, so yeah, that, that's, that's where we are at the moment, but go on, tell me a little bit more. So once you had that initial briefing and you sort of looked at the presentation, you got under the skin of it, kinda what, what next? 
 Speaker 2 (20:55 - 21:20): 
Um, yeah, once had the initial conversations went through the report and the different concepts and then the different sample groups and yeah, my main task was to pick out kind of like the key quotes, um, that would summarize their sentiments of that sample group. Mm-Hmm. Pretty much towards the different concepts that were tested. Um, and then I went on to beings and then try and find those quotes. 
 Speaker 1 (21:20 - 21:26): 
And so who, who took you on, who showed you beings for the first time? Was it, or did they just say like, click on this link and see what happens? 
 Speaker 2 (21:27 - 21:36): 
[laugh], I think, um, it was kind of a mixture, Peter. I think maybe Ridder as well. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] like a quick kind of demo. Yeah. And how it works. 
 Speaker 1 (21:37 - 21:44): 
Cool. Nice. Um, and so as you approached that analysis, what, um, yeah, what was just, what was the first thing you wanted to, to try and do? 
 Speaker 2 (21:46 - 21:54): 
I think, because I know you mentioned earlier to only select a few of the, the interviews or something, I actually selected all of them, which makes [laugh]. 
 Speaker 1 (21:55 - 21:57): 
And did it break completely or 
 Speaker 2 (21:58 - 22:27): 
It didn't break completely? It did, it did do some, give me some good quotes actually. Um, but it, it kind of makes more sense just choosing, for instance, it's like the four I have on the screen for HAC, like having a child rather than like all of them in the sample. And I guess it's less information I say for it to process. But yeah, that's my initially selected all, um, and asked it to kinda give me like four key co quotes. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] from each sample group on this concept or something like that. 
 Speaker 1 (22:28 - 22:54): 
Okay. Gotcha. Nice. Cool. Um, so, uh, uh, as you were starting to, yeah, so what was sort of the first question. What was your first kind of goal that you were trying to achieve? You were just trying to get some quotes out of it, um, as quickly as possible that, and you already had an idea in your head of like what you wanted those quotes to say? Or like how did you know whether that Ada was giving you what, what you needed or not? I suppose? Um, 
 Speaker 2 (22:55 - 23:11): 
Yeah, I think for the quotes I was trying to find, it was just more general sentiments of each sample group. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] and their feeling towards the concepts and then just the general sentiments overall. Yeah. Gotcha. [crosstalk] as a group. Yeah. I think that was the 
 Speaker 1 (23:11 - 23:23): 
Main, so why don't you go ahead and, um, maybe just click on, uh, Louis, Louis or Louis, I dunno. Um, yeah. Uh, and then just, yeah, just, just just show me what you, what you would've typed. I know it doesn't, doesn't have to be perfect, but like, whatever it was. Um, 
 Speaker 2 (23:25 - 23:51): 
Something along the lines of recently on this, I think. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Cool. Yeah, 
 Speaker 1 (23:52 - 23:54): 
Then go ahead and fire that off. Cool. 
 Speaker 2 (24:01 - 24:01): 
Okay. 
 Speaker 1 (24:01 - 24:42): 
Okay, great. And then before you do the next step, why don't you just go ahead and click next to the word chat. It, there's a little toggle. Um, we've kept it a bit subtle for now, but if you just toggle that the other way, lemme see that at the top of the chat. Okay. Yeah, there you go. It should just take you into advanced mode. Um, and then, um, why don't we use something from that, that kind of four Cs, um, concept, um, just to kind of in that conversational style, just to keep the conversation going. Right? So, um, something like, you know, that's an interesting quote. Uh, can you expand on this or just, or I don't know, is there anything Yeah, does anything come to mind that might be, uh, yeah. Relevant to what you were trying to achieve? 
 Speaker 2 (24:44 - 24:44): 
Oops. 
 Speaker 1 (24:45 - 24:48): 
Oh, no, no. I mean, I mean for you like, uh, oh, 
 Speaker 2 (24:48 - 24:48): 
[laugh], 
 Speaker 1 (24:48 - 26:00): 
Sorry. Um, so he, what he said, so Louis said, I'm a bit of an actual skeptic, so I do wonder what feeds into how they calculate, you know, their actual health age. I think the concept's quite appealing. It's an assessment for how are we doing, uh, I guess, you know, yeah. So you could say something like, that's an interesting quote. You could just for now just try to like expand on this, um, and see what it comes back with. Or tell me more. Yeah, just sort of something simple. Um, do you notice already it's taken slightly longer, but again, so that is in advanced mode and so sometimes you don't need advanced mode and it's just easier to sort of move quicker. Um, and you'll sort of see also comes back with quite a bit more. So like, um, it, again, it might be too much. You might find, oh, it's taking ages to read. Um, but, uh, but equally you might find, oh, you can skim it sometimes and go, oh, there's some interesting, maybe there's something interesting here that I can explore further. Right. So further, um, go on, tell me your impression of that in relation to what you were trying to analyze. Um, and is there anything there that, uh, 
 Speaker 2 (26:05 - 26:18): 
Yeah, it's quite interesting. Um, it's kind of like summarized it into different themes as well. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], which is useful. Yeah. Like the, the issues that they have with it. 
 Speaker 1 (26:19 - 26:19): 
Cool. 
 Speaker 2 (26:22 - 26:32): 
Yeah. And like these are things that we eventually came to the conclusion of as well. Mm-Hmm. Through the research, but with that advanced toggle, we just get it a bit quicker I guess. Cool. 
 Speaker 1 (26:32 - 27:22): 
Um, so then scroll down to the bottom of that. Um, that response, you see there's three icons that appear when you hover over the chat box, uh, sorry, over the response box. If you h hover over the text down at the bottom right, they're a bit subtle there, but if you hover over each but your mouse over each of those one by one, you'll see there's a convert to source which sends it to the left [laugh], and the next one along is convert to note. So the difference with note and source is as when it's a note, you could edit it. So if you just click convert to note a moment, and there's also like a copy. So if you just needed to copy that, the last one on the right there just copies that. So if you wanted just to take it straight into a, a Word document or something just to again, be able to sort of make your own notes off the platform, you can do that as well. Um, seems to be stuck thinking about that one, doesn't it? 
 Speaker 2 (27:28 - 27:29): 
And it saves here. 
 Speaker 1 (27:30 - 27:37): 
Yes. It should just appear at the top there in a minute. Um, is that the one? 
 Speaker 2 (27:38 - 27:41): 
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (27:42 - 28:21): 
Yeah. Cool. Um, and then you can see there's a little sort of text icon at the bottom if you do want to sort of change formatting and stuff like that, if you just click on that one pops up a little toolbar so you can sort of get some of the normal tools. Um, and then it's, it is just saving it automatically to go along so you can just hit escape to get outta that or the X at the top. Right. Um, and then equally, like once you finished that, say you were doing that for each of those individual, um, uh, participants. So like you went, you did Lewis and you did the same thing for Hannah, did the same thing for [inaudible], same thing for Chloe, and you ended up with like a few of those. You could then, um, push all of those back into a source and then select those, those is it 1, 2, 3, 4, count, 1, 2, 4. 
 Speaker 1 (28:21 - 29:23): 
Um, and then kind of ask another set of questions in relation to how they, where, where things might have been different. Do you see what I mean? Because they might all being, say, they might all be saying similar things, but there might be some nuances actually. Um, either in relation to their particular demographic, you know, they might be, or, or in relation to their personality. You know, you might be able to say, you know, looking at the, um, you know, the five different personality types, you're finding the introverts or whatever, or extroverts tend to be more like this or they tend to be responding in this way. Do you see what I mean? And you can start to um, sort of shift away at layers of, of, of, uh, yeah. Of things. Um, okay, cool. Uh, is that helpful as the sort of first step? I don't wanna overload you like there is a huge amount, it's also very open-ended, so being, making sure you stay really goal focused is really important. I know that sounds kind of sim silly, but like I just find myself going off down all sorts of rabbit holes unless I keep in mind like I, no, this is specifically what I'm analyzing right now. Or, 
 Speaker 2 (29:23 - 29:24): 
Um, yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (29:25 - 29:25): 
Being 
 Speaker 2 (29:25 - 29:30): 
Specific rather than, yeah. Cool. No, that was really useful. Thank you. 
 Speaker 1 (29:30 - 29:43): 
Cool. Is there anything else, um, in your sort of sort of workflow that, you know, the, the sort of tasks that you tend to be doing, um, that comes to mind that you'd just love to, uh, know a bit more about? Or, or even even just experiment while we're got a few more minutes in the session? 
 Speaker 2 (29:45 - 29:52): 
Um, I'm not too sure to be honest in terms of just like other, other projects and things, is that what you mean? 
 Speaker 1 (29:52 - 30:11): 
No, just like, is there anything else that you find yourself doing a lot, um, as part of your research process, um, which actually you wish could either be automated or that, is there any other kind of prompt, specific prompt questions where you're like, oh, I was trying to do this and just couldn't get it to give me anything useful? I dunno. Um, it might be too soon. You might need to just play a little bit more. Um, 
 Speaker 2 (30:11 - 30:18): 
Yeah, I might need to think a bit longer on that, but I'm sure there's yeah. Plenty of things that things are automated would be great. 
 Speaker 1 (30:18 - 30:27): 
[laugh]. Yeah. Yeah. Like what's the, on that automation thing? Like is or on your kind of, do you use track GBT and stuff in your personal life and all that kind of thing? Like, oh, that's 
 Speaker 2 (30:27 - 30:27): 
All. 
 Speaker 1 (30:27 - 30:33): 
Yeah. Is there anything there that you kind of see that you go, oh, I could really wish this existed in the research world. Like, um, 
 Speaker 2 (30:38 - 30:39): 
To be honest, I think you've captured it. 
 Speaker 1 (30:40 - 30:41): 
We've got the basics, 
 Speaker 2 (30:41 - 30:54): 
What we Yeah. In terms of like what we need. It's just being able to analyze a large chunk of information Mm. And getting like key findings pretty easily. Cool. That's for me, like the main thing when it comes to qu. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (30:55 - 31:38): 
Cool. Great. Um, yeah, we're playing with a number of different, uh, ideas. So, um, we're looking at kind of different ways of tagging, like different ways of like, um, uh, yeah, just kind of highlighting. So I guess just talking about the citations thing. So with, if you go over to Lewis, Louis, Lewis on the left hand side, next to the little tick box, there's a little kind of expand if you click that expand button, um, it shows you currently shows you the video. Um, but one of the things that we're planning to do is like for, for any of these kind of facts that come back within the, um, within the response from ada, just having a little clickable link that would just take you to that point, um, in the video. Um, do you think that would um, sort of increase, help increase your trust in the responses that are coming back? 
 Speaker 2 (31:40 - 31:58): 
I think so, yeah. Because you can just directly see I guess before and after the quote as well. Mm. Like yeah, and you can, you know, it's the quote's correct. If you can hear it as well, the respondent saying, and then you might not need to do that for every single quote that you get 'cause you trust it more. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (31:58 - 31:58): 
Yeah, 
 Speaker 2 (31:58 - 31:59): 
Yeah. Yeah. 
 Speaker 1 (32:00 - 32:39): 
Um, and are there any sort of either methodologies, um, that you'd love to have access to? Or like do the team ever say like, we'd like you to look at this in a particular way or using a particular framework? Um, or is it fairly kind of fairly open in terms of how you go about it? The each researcher chooses their different, um, their own different ways of working. Like what would you say, um, is, is your, is your experience? Yeah. Like, and, and do you need data to sort of suggest anything like that? Like, oh, if you use such and such a framework, um, you may be able to analyze a certain topic area in a particular, particular sort of way. Way. 
 Speaker 2 (32:40 - 32:58): 
Yeah. In terms of just like at the beginning of the project, deciding how to approach the research and mm-Hmm. [affirmative], things like that. Yeah. Um, this project wasn't involved in that, but I think it's always gonna be useful as well to have, I guess, AI help in that sense because it can sometimes be subjective to 
 Speaker 1 (32:58 - 32:59): 
Oh yeah. 
 Speaker 2 (32:59 - 33:12): 
Approach. Yeah. So like, having that and maybe considering like different approaches and pros and cons, getting like a rounded view quickly as well is always gonna be useful in my opinion for sure. Cool. 
 Speaker 1 (33:12 - 33:51): 
Um, and then one other thing. And the big plus button sort of in the middle center left, if you just hover over that, um, you'll see Okay. A couple, yeah, a couple of tools there. So there's the uploads just for uploading things. So again, at the moment you can kind of do like, you know, text files, documents, PDFs, those sorts of files at the moment. You can also upload videos or audio as well. So if it was just an audio recording that you've done in like voice memo on your phone or whatever, um, you can get that file and upload it. And then the next one along there, if you just click that next one along, um, uh, it loads up a little popup. Um, and this, uh, is not like an officially released feature yet. We're just asking people to sort of try it out and give us feedback. 
 Speaker 1 (33:51 - 34:31): 
So don't use it for recording participants. Um, yeah. But love to get feedback on people, um, just recording internal meetings, you know, something that's sort of a little bit less, um, super critical. Um, and then, uh, so you, you could essentially, if you're in teams, you can essentially choose the, you need in the calendar invite or in the teams software itself. You can kind of click the copy link and you can place that in there and hit start recording. Um, and then in the same way that I've got Ada here in our meeting, um, she will, uh, join, she'll join your waiting room first. You have to like click to let her in, um, sort of as in when you, you want her to join. Um, and you can kick her out at any point as well. Um, and she can just record and capture that meeting. 
 Speaker 1 (34:31 - 35:19): 
And then that will appear stray in your project files, um, on the left as well. So again, if you were doing some either internal conversations, um, or in future, if you were doing client conversations, client meetings where you just wanna capture all of that, uh, um, sort of context into your project, um, I can give you a much, much richer source of, um, of material to then kind of, uh, be working with. And again, you can go through a similar sort of analysis process, create some notes, and that can become like the framework. So say you did an internal meeting where you discussed, you're gonna use a specific framework, you can kind of build a, um, uh, a note, for example, um, that has all of the, the specification for that, um, change that into a source. And then when you select your sources instead of just clicking Lewis, you could click Lewis and that kind of, that context. 
 Speaker 1 (35:20 - 35:57): 
And then it would just give Ada again, a little bit of a richer context to guide the responses that she's giving you. So, um, so yeah, love to have a little play with that. If you do get an opportunity, um, and give, giving us some feedback on that would be great. Um, but yeah, I'm happy to do as many prompting sessions as is helpful. Um, or if something just comes to mind, it's like that sort of thing. It's like when you are using it, usually, like Ben sends you really angry emails going, Dave's not doing this [laugh]. Okay, we'll work on that. We'll work on that. And they can usually get, um, a fix done like relatively quickly for Yeah. Um, for specific things. So we, yeah, just feel free to, to reach out if there's anything that I can help with. 
 Speaker 2 (35:58 - 36:03): 
That's good. No, you're right. It's when you're doing it is when you, you you come across things, you're like, okay, yeah, 
 Speaker 1 (36:03 - 36:04): 
Yeah. Freshest at that point. Need 
 Speaker 2 (36:04 - 36:05): 
Some help on that. Yeah, 
 Speaker 1 (36:05 - 36:15): 
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cool. Um, brilliant. Well, are you, have you got any other questions? I'll share those two documents with you. Um, and yeah, have a play. All good. Great. 
 Speaker 2 (36:15 - 36:17): 
Yeah. Thanks very much for your help. 
 Speaker 1 (36:17 - 36:22): 
You're very welcome. It's really great to meet you. And, um, yeah, good to meet you. Please, please feel free to reach out if there's anything at all. 
 Speaker 2 (36:23 - 36:27): 
Thanks. Thanks so much. Have a good one. Nice to meet you. Bye. Bye.
