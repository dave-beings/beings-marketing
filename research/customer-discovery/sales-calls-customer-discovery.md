Hi guys. You hear me right?
S1
Speaker 1
02:10
02:10
Yeah, yeah, I hear you. Can you hear me?
S0
Speaker 0
02:13
02:13
Yeah, I guess. Sorry. This whole Google thing is not something I use often.
S1
Speaker 1
02:19
02:19
Uh, what ecosystem are you, are you in Microsoft or something?
S0
Speaker 0
02:24
02:24
Well, I am on Microsoft and I hate it. So it's, it's even worse than Google. So Google is shit, but like Microsoft is way far, you know, even, even than that. Um, which is your favorite, but I'm forced by my it, so we're, we're using Zoom still, so we're fighting against dropping Zoom. Zoom is the absolute best thing ever. Cool. Nothing can zoom
S1
Speaker 1
02:48
02:48
[laugh]. What is it you like so much about Zoom then?
S0
Speaker 0
02:51
02:51
[laugh]? Everything. You know, it never crashes. It always works. Never wags. Um, I've been using it for like four years.
S1
Speaker 1
02:59
02:59
Yeah. Yeah. And, um,
S0
Speaker 0
03:01
03:01
Not a single issue. I don't know why, but in like 10 different countries and whatever kind of connectivity you have, have been the places where you have a lot of expression like, uh, middle East and stuff. Still perfect,
S1
Speaker 1
03:14
03:14
Still perfect while
S0
Speaker 0
03:15
03:15
Everything else drop. I mean, Microsoft is the worst, like teams is, is is something you should avoid at any cost, you know?
S1
Speaker 1
03:23
03:23
Thankfully, I've never had
S0
Speaker 0
03:25
03:25
Too much
S1
Speaker 1
03:26
03:26
In teams.
S0
Speaker 0
03:27
03:27
Even if you're being paid to use it, never do it. 'cause it's really bad.
S1
Speaker 1
03:31
03:31
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just always found the user experience just horrible. Really. I just found it, you know, so clunky, so messy and Yeah. And technically all the,
S0
Speaker 0
03:40
03:40
Yeah, they, they, they made it better. I, I should, I should say that. So they made it bit better. It's not like Skype anymore, because Skype was like, this is your ultimate crap, you know,
S1
Speaker 1
03:50
03:50
[laugh],
S0
Speaker 0
03:51
03:51
This is what, what
S1
Speaker 1
03:52
03:52
It was just old outdated technology. I think like Zoom had the advantage of the, um, you know, the Cisco, the historic kind of Cisco Now. How so? I think they had that networking side of things. Uh,
S0
Speaker 0
04:05
04:05
You hear my kids screaming, I guess, right?
S1
Speaker 1
04:06
04:06
It sounds like it. Do you need to check? No worries.
S0
Speaker 0
04:38
04:38
Yeah. Sorry about that. Um, they had a little, how, how old are
S1
Speaker 1
04:41
04:41
They?
S0
Speaker 0
04:44
04:44
Uh, well, I have a lot. So it's 1, 4, 6, and 10.
S1
Speaker 1
04:50
04:50
Oh, very good. Very good. I have, uh, yeah, five. Those
S0
Speaker 0
04:53
04:53
Two were were four and one. They were trying to Yeah. Make some agreement between themselves and it didn't work out. [laugh], [laugh].
S1
Speaker 1
05:05
05:05
Fair enough. Uh, whereabouts are you? Where do you live?
S0
Speaker 0
05:11
05:11
Um, I'm in France and Paris.
S1
Speaker 1
05:13
05:13
Oh, okay. Lovely. C uh, so how do you know Mark, and, uh, more importantly, like how did knowing Mark mean that you took this phone call [laugh]?
S0
Speaker 0
05:25
05:25
Um, well, I take pretty much any phone call he would suggest me. It takes [laugh] [laugh]. Oh, bless him. So I have no idea. I have no idea what to do. So we, we will have to discuss that. But, uh, the way I know Mark is, uh, yeah, that, that goes back quite, quite a decade, I think. Um, so I was, um, I was a CDO at a, uh, at a large, uh, telco company. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] at one point. Uh, and, uh, yeah, he was, uh, his, his team was working with, with, with my team on some Android services and stuff. Yes. At that point we were, we were, um, well that was 2000 15, 16, 17. So yeah, we were building like telco driven ecosystem kind of stuff, and we're looking for all sorts of different services and strong partnerships. And one of the units I was running was, was the, uh, digital partnerships thing.
S0
Speaker 0
06:25
06:25
Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So we worked with Apple's, Facebook's, Google's, all these guys. And so Mark's team, which was also my team from the previous job, so, um, right. Uh, uh, he, they, they introduced me to him. He came over to Moscow and we met a couple of times and discussing all the strategic kind of projects. And ever since then, we've been in touch for whatever reason. I don't know really. [laugh], he's a nice guy. Now, his team has even more people whom I know, because I worked for Apple before that for quite a long time. And, uh, some of the guys who work for him now in northern Europe and the uk, uh, they used to be my, uh, mates in, in, in the Apple London office. And yeah. So we have more, uh, connection than you would imagine. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
07:17
07:17
Yeah. Loads and loads of overlap over the years. Ah, that's very cool. I think that's just the way the world works, isn't it? If you build up relationships
S0
Speaker 0
07:23
07:23
And, and Yeah. And so I, I talked to him actually about what, four, five weeks back, I guess. Uh, okay. We had like a, you know, typical regular sort of catch up thing. Yeah. And, uh, yeah, just discussed where we were and how those last couple of years, uh, sort of affected us, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. And I just told him what I'm doing, and, uh, he did, he didn't know I was already at, uh, farm Window. That's already like six years. Yeah, yeah. Um, quite a long time. Wow. Uh, and, uh, yeah. And, and then, and he said, yeah, if I have whatever for you, I'll, I'll throw it it to you. And I said, I'll do the same. And here we are. So cool. He sent me a couple of emails and one of those is you, so I don't know why, but, uh. Oh,
S1
Speaker 1
08:12
08:12
Very cool. Um, so yeah, so what is it that you do then? So obviously it says it's got a nice fancy title on LinkedIn, and obviously that's Sanofi. Um, I've worked with Sanofi at some point in my history, like a long time ago as a contractor. Um, but mm-Hmm. [affirmative], yeah. Not for a long time. And it was in a very different kind of area to what I'm doing now. Um, but yeah. What is it that you do?
S0
Speaker 0
08:34
08:34
Uh, so I'm part of that unit, which is called, um, digital healthcare, um, Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] essentially, uh, this is, this is like a little startup, uh, within the corporation. Um, Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] not that little anymore, but I guess. But, uh, uh, so what we do is we, we do patient, uh, orientated services. So, uh, uh, specifically in the area of, uh, chronic disease management like your, you know, diabetes, cardiovascular, all that stuff that happens to you and then never goes away really. And you have to adjust your lifestyle and whatnot. Hmm. Uh, and, uh, like from a big picture perspective, there are two, two boxes really of stuff we do. One is, uh, your very standardized, very pharma, um, so-called psps, uh, patient support programs. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So this is a very standardized, very specific term. And, uh, there you just do, um, essentially digital services around your drug, uh, administration process.
S0
Speaker 0
09:44
09:44
Okay. Yeah. So you, you can have a certain, you know, uh, I don't know, Dupixent, which is our major, major drug now, which is, uh, around, uh, asthma, uh mm-Hmm. Chronic customer condition. Mm-Hmm. And, uh, yeah. And you need to have an app where you can kind of quickly diagnose yourself through a, uh, phone and then get the, uh, get the, you know, education elements and, you know, know what you're doing and connect with your doctor and have a telemed in there. So, you know, stuff like that. Who, um, that's one box. This is pretty standard. Uh, we are sort of just supporting, uh, the pharma brands. And on the other side, what we're trying to do really is, is, is build a, um, platform, um, for, um, well, right now we're focused on diabetes mainly. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] on, um, like a disease management thing.
S0
Speaker 0
10:39
10:39
I don't know if you heard of, I don't know which ones are the most famous now, maybe on dual by Google or, uh, Livongo or stuff like that. So where, where you actually have your, uh, kind of companion in a phone that would help you deal with your disease. You show you your blood glucose data, it would get access to your doctor. It would contain all of your, um, you know, numbers and stuff that you could share with your, with your physician. And Wow. You would have the structured education there so that you can run through like YouTube type clips of Yeah, yeah. Simple education, how to live with diabetes and stuff. That's amazing. And then bunch of other things there. And so it was also connected with the, with the sensors, which, which track their blood glucose and stuff. Yeah. Um, so that's a major, it's a major market, uh, right now because the diabetes is a, is a huge, well, it is, it is.
S0
Speaker 0
11:36
11:36
It is already officially a, um, an epidemic by, uh, the World, world Health Organization standards. Uh, yeah. Give them the number of people who are sick with it, and the number of, and and, and the growth really, the, the speed with which you get, you add new patients, it is technically a, an epidemic. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and so I, I'm not gonna go into a lot of details. So we, we do, um, uh, things around that. Uh, and what I do specifically is, is, um, I am in charge of regional strategy and operations. So, which, which that, what that means is I, I am in charge of launching specific local projects. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], because healthcare is fragmented by, by design. It is, it is embedded into, you know, national healthcare systems Yeah. Stuff. So it, it is local inherently, and you, you don't have like global healthcare market or something. It doesn't, doesn't exist because it's all usually government driven or local regulation driven, et cetera. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, but we're trying to adopt our, uh, global strategy and global solutions to, uh, be relevant to particular markets. And so I'm in charge of rolling out those, those specific countries. Um, so right now
S1
Speaker 1
13:01
13:01
That's fascinating to me. Like, do, so do you ba do you essentially, as you build out the technology, have to build quite a decentralized approach in terms of how you structure the tech to ensure that you comply with all the regulation in the different healthcare systems? Like
S0
Speaker 0
13:15
13:15
Yeah. That must be
S1
Speaker 1
13:16
13:16
Quite a large challenge.
S0
Speaker 0
13:18
13:18
Yeah. Yeah. So there, there are two elements of this. First of all, we are essentially focused on building the backend Mm. For the system. 'cause the, the overall business model is, uh, is, is is data management. So we're giving the actual end user service for free. We don't charge for it. Mm-Hmm mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, and, uh, we do that in exchange for data. So we get data from the customers and then we anonymize it and all these other things which pharma has to do. Um, and, uh, then we reuse it in a way that we enhance the, uh, you know, the, the experience and essentially give that back to the end user and, you know, make the services better. Mm-Hmm. And, uh, the backend stuff can, can work globally. It is, it is not easy. Uh, like markets like China, for example, that that would be incredibly difficult to, uh, to, uh, pull this off in.
S0
Speaker 0
14:21
14:21
But still, we have a Chinese project as well, which is completely separated from the rest of it, but Right. Well's follow, they're, they're not that many markets which are at as crazy as, as the Chinese. Okay. The rest are more favorable. And then when it comes to the front end services, which, which are customer facing and customer, both patient facing and physician facing, and the care team facing Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], all of those were not intending to build our, you know, ourselves. We have built elements, uh mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And we know how to, you know, like, I'll give you an example. For example, the education piece like pharma is, is huge in that. So if pharma has decades of experience training, uh, both care teams and patients on certain solutions to battle with those diseases, right? So for example, we know we have our content, we, we, you know, we have all of this figured out, but the front end services really use, uh, partnerships.
S0
Speaker 0
15:27
15:27
So we come into the market, we look for what's best there in the area. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And, uh, we partner with them Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And we launch our stuff through those local partners, uh, that also gives us access and, you know, makes it easier to enter, because like the, my my, my main project now is Saudi Arabia. Okay. Uh, that is, and, and my second project now, which was just signed actually last week, uh, finally all the paperwork and we're launching the kickoff two weeks from now is Mexico. So you, you can't really find too many commonalities between two, those, those two places, [laugh] very, uh, very different, as different as could be. Right? Yeah. Almost. So, and that way it's really, as you say, it's very hard to see how you can stretch one solution to be relevant to so diverse environment. Yeah. Yeah. Also, you know, the regulation is very different.
S0
Speaker 0
16:29
16:29
And, uh, and, and also the way, uh, healthcare market works is you have a, an important element, which is called the payer. Mm-Hmm. So this is usually, well, someone who pays for healthcare services, usually this is the government. Yeah. Uh, like in the uk your, your, your payer would be NHS. Yeah. Uh, and, uh, but UK is not a single payer system. You, you've got some, uh, insurance companies, you've got some, um, private, uh, clinics, et cetera. But say France is essentially a single payer system. So here there is only the government, much more centralized government Yeah. The government with whom you have to work, and then they will give you access to things. And, um, like in Mexico, there is no centralized system. Uh, they are well, as messy as it gets, it's, it's like, um, in a good way.
S0
Speaker 0
17:27
17:27
Um, there's not much regulation. So this is like a wild west, so you can do a lot of things there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, and well, Saudi Arabia area, yeah. It is very opposite. So there everything is completely like, controlled and very tight. Um, yeah. And just to finish all the speech, so I'm, I'm actually, uh, I have got no background in, in, in healthcare. So that's my first and last maybe job, uh, in the, in the area. Uh, and so I worked before in the telco business for quite some time. That's when I met Mark for about 10 years. I worked for two major telecom companies. Yeah. Doing new services and stuff. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And then I worked for Apple for some time, and then I worked for, uh, also software development company in Singapore Global one where we did blockchain based solutions for data protection. Uh, okay. And then the last one,
S1
Speaker 1
18:27
18:27
A lot of very
S0
Speaker 0
18:28
18:28
Innovative stuff. Yeah. Always innovative. Yeah, exactly. And the last thing I did before joining pharma, I worked for a video game company. So that was, uh, that was fun. It's like Mexico and Saudi Arabia. You can't really see a lot of similarities between video games and then healthcare. Yeah. Because as far as it gets really [laugh], uh, in, in many ways. Uh, but it was fun. Yeah. I was a VP for new business development and, um, and, and, and a major publisher. So I had to source games Yeah. To publish.
S1
Speaker 1
19:02
19:02
Okay.
S0
Speaker 0
19:02
19:02
Yeah. Yeah. In different markets. I mean, anyway, that's, so,
S1
Speaker 1
19:05
19:05
That sounds so totally different [laugh] to what
S0
Speaker 0
19:08
19:08
You were doing. Yeah, exactly. Well,
S1
Speaker 1
19:11
19:11
But the variety is the spice of life. I totally subscribe to that, uh, that philosophy. So I think you've done very well there.
S0
Speaker 0
19:19
19:19
Well, tell me what, what is it you guys do?
S1
Speaker 1
19:22
19:22
Uh, so we are a customer research startup. We started in January, 2023. Uh, and Google was our first customer [laugh]. Uh, so we got very fortunate with them. Uh, it was very timely. I, I created a, an early prototype of, uh, a customer engagement, customer research system, uh, that allowed field research Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So it allowed remote re uh, research to take place instead of, like, historically where the Google's researchers would either bring participants into their lab environments in their offices, or where their researchers would go out, you know, with a clipboard and type up all the notes and ask questions of customers as they go. Uh, we kind of facilitated, uh, is a web RTC based system, but also some of the higher end kind of broadcast protocols integrated in there for the higher end camera systems in the lab environments. Um, but essentially we created a, um, a research system, uh, that the Google UX team could use primarily for product research.
S1
Speaker 1
20:15
20:15
Um, but mm-Hmm. [affirmative], uh, but I'm looking more broadly to get into customer research and, and healthcare longer term, because I think there's a big opportunity to have a, a more impactful, um, uh, more impact basically in the healthcare world. Longer term. I think research in the field can be such a hard thing to do and such a hard thing to do well. But I think the tools that, that we have these days, the, the, the ability to have that real time communication and the ability to apply natural language processing to what a research is saying and to what a participant is answering to make sure that they get better quality research and better quality insights out of the systems. Um, so yeah, that's kind of what I'm about. Uh, was really interested to hear what you were saying there about your kind of patient engagement, um, and sort of how you, how you go about doing that, um, to see if there's any Yeah. Any challenges that you have. You know, we've just, uh, raised finance, um, and so we've got a reasonable amount of money, uh, and I'm just trying to work out exactly where to spend that money next. Um, in terms of what to, what to lean into. Um, and I'd love to start making ways into healthcare, but I do appreciate it's probably a three to five year journey. 'cause it's quite a challenge, a regulatory challenge from everything that everyone tells me. Um,
S0
Speaker 0
21:30
21:30
Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
21:31
21:31
Tell
S0
Speaker 0
21:31
21:31
Me about your engagement. And it's, it's, it is, it is really not an easy, uh, one, um, 'cause you will have to comply with all sorts of, uh, sometimes incredibly stupid as you might think of them, uh, regulations. But then I'm, I'm, I'm, I've been here six years and, uh, I, I still, I still find a lot of this stuff just useless and redundant to be honest. But, um, sorts things I'm slowly getting Yeah. I'm slowly getting to where all the pharma people are. Uh mm-Hmm. Like, I'm starting to appreciate this whole thing, but, uh, um, yeah, it's hard. Yeah. Yeah. Especially, especially when you move from your traditional standardized offline interaction to your new world, which we both represent. Um, then what pharma typically does is, and then one thing I learned, which I think you should be aware of from the very beginning, it's really not. Sorry. So, major problem is really not the regulation.
S1
Speaker 1
22:46
22:46
Okay.
S0
Speaker 0
22:47
22:47
Uh, the regulation is something you can read about. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And essentially it, it is being tackled by filling out forms Right. With the right words and sending them to the right people. And then waiting until they, you know, like
S1
Speaker 1
23:02
23:02
It's just process. That's just a matter of managing process.
S0
Speaker 0
23:04
23:04
Yeah. It's just process. And, and, and you have to do something on your end as well. But it's not that difficult. It's usually just, you need to know the process and you need to adjust to it, which is doable. Uh, um, and if you're a small enough company, then for you, that's even easier. You don't have to rebuild a lot of stuff to comply with. No stuff.
S1
Speaker 1
23:30
23:30
Oh, you just muted for some reason. Did something just phone. Didn't your computer just try And that was weird. Your audio just disappeared and then went on mute as if something on your computer interrupted the, the audio. That's weird. Maybe just disconnect and rejoin if that, if it doesn't come back.
S0
Speaker 0
23:54
23:54
Can you hear me now?
S1
Speaker 1
23:55
23:55
Ah, yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. That was weird. Sorry.
S0
Speaker 0
23:58
23:58
I don't know. Yeah. I, that's when I started believing in, uh, in aliens and stuff. 'cause
S1
Speaker 1
24:05
24:05
[laugh] ghost in the machine.
S0
Speaker 0
24:07
24:07
Yeah. What happened is, is all of the Bluetooth devices that were connected to my computer, which is my keyboard, my track pad, and my earphones just disconnected in one second.
S1
Speaker 1
24:17
24:17
Oh.
S0
Speaker 0
24:19
24:19
And then they reconnected back. Then they
S1
Speaker 1
24:20
24:20
Connect. So wait, instantaneously.
S0
Speaker 0
24:22
24:22
I don't know. Anyway. Doesn't matter. Um, uh, by the way, did you watch that, uh, or read the book? Maybe I'm reading the book now, but I just watched the Netflix thing, uh, which was obviously quicker. This Chinese, uh, guy, the, the three body problem?
S1
Speaker 1
24:38
24:38
No, what's
S0
Speaker 0
24:39
24:39
That? No, do that. I mean, this is wild.
S1
Speaker 1
24:42
24:42
Go on. Um,
S0
Speaker 0
24:43
24:43
Uh, this is like a new sci-fi stuff. Um, and, uh, 'cause I, I I, I grew up in, in the eastern part of, of, of Russia. Right. And, uh, my, my first education is, is really my major is, is linguistics. And, um, one of the languages I learned was Chinese and I lived in China.
S1
Speaker 1
25:04
25:04
China. Oh, cool.
S0
Speaker 0
25:05
25:05
And so I kind know the way they think and operate. Um, unfortunately, there is nothing, the west doesn't understand them at all. At least if you base it on the mass media, we're going into disaster. Whatever is being told about the Chinese on your media, don't believe it. It's bullshit. It's like utter bullshit. Not not just bullshit, it's just utter bullshit based on
S1
Speaker 1
25:32
25:32
Based in what? Respect, what would you say is the main thing That we,
S0
Speaker 0
25:35
25:35
In a way, in a way that they, they actually perceive the world in a very different way. Okay. Um, and we tend to just like, uh, the west looks at the Russians and the Russians look at the West, for example. We tend to look at each other from our own point of view. So we, we kind of take our like set of, uh, I don't know, principles and, uh, and um, yeah. Yeah. Our beliefs
S1
Speaker 1
25:58
25:58
About the world
S0
Speaker 0
25:59
25:59
Beliefs, and we kind of try to map what these guys do to that.
S1
Speaker 1
26:03
26:03
Ah, yeah. Okay.
S0
Speaker 0
26:04
26:04
Which is the wrong way to do it.
S1
Speaker 1
26:05
26:05
Yeah, yeah. Because
S0
Speaker 0
26:06
26:06
They operate in a completely different set of, of values these guys, and the difference between the west and the Russians, for example, and I, I, I apologize for the term West because it just, you know, it doesn't exist. You know, there are very different things, but, but at this, it's just easier for a discussion perspective, right?
S1
Speaker 1
26:22
26:22
Yeah. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
26:23
26:23
Um, uh, we're not that far from each other actually, because we're part of the same European kind of civilization. Yeah. So it just, but when you look at these kind of guys from the East, which have 5,000 year long history, a completely different kind of way of developing the civilization, and we're trying to map them against what we think is right.
S1
Speaker 1
26:47
26:47
Yeah. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
26:48
26:48
What, what we get is we get scared usually [laugh]. Yes. The reality is we shouldn't because they are fundamentally different in the way they perceive everything. And, uh, usually when you get scared, you think others are hostile and they're trying to get to you.
S1
Speaker 1
27:07
27:07
Oh, I see. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
27:09
27:09
Which is really not the case. They have a very different agenda. But anyhow, that's a whole different story. What, what, what I'm bringing this up is, is because there, this latest guy, uh, I, I can I can send you an email, but, uh, uh, a Chinese writer, he wrote, um, um, like three books, uh mm-Hmm. [affirmative] sci-Fi books Done by a Chinese guy for the Chinese audience. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So it is incredibly, uh, I don't know how to put that. I don't know the words for it, but it, it, it's, it, it is very complex. Very, uh, very well, a lot of sus Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], you know, the way you wouldn't imagine how, how, how terrified you get when you watch or read that. Yeah. Yeah. And they have a very different view, and it's about aliens. Okay. The, the fact that we're not alone in the universe and, uh Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] that the universe is actually coming to us, um Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And, um, it'll not be pleasant when we meet with those other guys. Right. Um, it's pretty fun. But, and what's it called? Just launched? Uh, it's called the Three Body Problem.
S1
Speaker 1
28:19
28:19
The Three Body Problem. Okay.
S0
Speaker 0
28:21
28:21
Yeah. Uh, look it up at Netflix. They, they only did like eight, eight, uh, episodes for now. This is like 10% of the book. Uh, so I'm assuming there will be more coming. Mm-Hmm. But this one is fascinating. And, and then, and then the book is in English as well, so, uh, it, there are three books actually. Uh, but anyway, it, it's great. I'm, I'm, I'm,
S1
Speaker 1
28:43
28:43
It's, it's interesting because it's quite revealing about the difference then in mentality or the difference in like mindset and the whole fundamental difference. Is that what you're getting at? Yeah,
S0
Speaker 0
28:51
28:51
Yeah. It's, it's, it's two things. One, you, you really re if you look at it from a perspective of that's how those people actually perceive everything and look at it, uh, that that's one perspective. Mm. And the second perspective is just the actual plot itself. So I doubt the Western mind could produce that.
S1
Speaker 1
29:12
29:12
Think of it. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha.
S0
Speaker 0
29:14
29:14
And, and, and, and, and then the actual story in there, uh, which we usually in our, like say European, uh, mass media, we, we tend to, um, kind of look at it a little, a little, um, differently. But essentially what, and then the guy got, did a bunch of interviews and he says essentially the following, he says, I, I don't understand why, uh, humans by now would, um, in 2024 would still be of so low opinion of their own neighbors Mm. Like neighboring countries. So Yeah. Yeah. We're the same species like Americans, French, Germans, Japanese, whatever, the same species. These are human beings living in the same planet, in the same conditions, et cetera, et cetera. And we are so suspicious and unfriendly to each other and think that the guy across the virtual border, which we invented ourselves Yeah. Is so hostile that he wants to get to you and get your stuff and then whatever kill you and whatnot.
S0
Speaker 0
30:24
30:24
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we're so, and we're so fundamentally, uh, looking forward to the guys somewhere up there. Yeah. Um, in space, we somehow think there will be friendly Mm-Hmm. Who are sending messages out there in the space. Oh, we're friendly, planet, come talk to us, et cetera. And I find this big extremely weird that we, we, we, we hate each other, but we somehow love somebody out there whom we don't even understand who we even look like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and he says, in my view, it's exactly the opposite. We should absolutely unite like instantaneously as humans because we are exactly the same. These are our brothers sisters. We are a human race, and we should be scared to death of the guys up there.
S1
Speaker 1
31:14
31:14
It might be out there. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
31:16
31:16
Because most probably those ones, especially if they manage to come to us from the outer space.
S1
Speaker 1
31:24
31:24
Yeah,
S0
Speaker 0
31:24
31:24
Yeah. You assume they would have much superior technology. And we usually know what happens when your, your Spanish, uh, odors come to your, um, Mexican Indians with, uh, arrows and, and you know. Yes. And we know usually what happens there is co colonization, uh, yeah. Is going on at demo, because you can't compete with these guiding guys. And these we're fundamentally screwed up in the way we, we as human race, we understand all this. And so the story is about, uh, how, how that unfolds. Amazing. It has absolutely fascinating.
S1
Speaker 1
31:59
31:59
I was gonna Yeah, that sounds amazing. Have a look.
S1
Speaker 1
32:01
32:01
Yeah. So I grew up in a, in Switzerland and in my sort of my early school schooling, there was 23 different nationalities in my class of 24 students. So I had that completely kind of international, uh, bringing up. And then, uh, through my career as a grownup, I've always kind of moved around and worked about 90% of my time in different countries, um, kind of all around the world. And I agree completely with that philosophy. Like, people are just all the same, people are just people everywhere. Like, there's people that don't sort of travel and don't have the experience of, of multiple nationalities really, really miss out on,
S0
Speaker 0
32:39
32:39
On a
S1
Speaker 1
32:39
32:39
Huge part of life. But cool. Look, we've, uh, we've used up half an hour of your time. I'm really
S0
Speaker 0
32:44
32:44
Grateful. Yeah. I'll, I'll give you two minute, two more minutes. So, uh, I think, I think really for you we're, would be easier to start maybe is exactly with the guys like us, like, I mean, the team I work for. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, because we are, we're not a, a typical kind of pharma, uh, operation. We would tend to, we actually are in the process of sort of spinning, spinning out of, of, of the corporation just to get rid of some of the regulations as well. Yeah. We, we, uh,
S1
Speaker 1
33:17
33:17
Bureaucratic in a big pharma company. Huge.
S0
Speaker 0
33:19
33:19
Yes. Huge part of our, um, experience, which we try to build into those solutions is exactly, um, is exactly about, uh, lifestyle consumer normal UX ui, which is not typical for the healthcare world. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Yeah. Usually everything is screwed up completely here and it's cumbersome to use and whatever. Yeah. Yeah. So that's probably the best place to start and not, you know, people like us. Um, so what I suggest we do, because we do a bunch of UX UI research now and we're designing the platform and there is a whole team which is dedicated to, um, to, uh, experience. Yeah. And, uh, we love working with new partners. So Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] over the last two years since I was in France, I think we hired about a dozen of new vendors across the board because usually we can't get, as a team, we can't get what we need to get through traditional normal pharma.
S1
Speaker 1
34:18
34:18
That was exactly the problem Google had. Yeah, exactly the same problem with Google. Like they had to either work, um, internally or they had to find these ways to just gently navigate around the official. Um, and actually working with partners was really the, the only way they could achieve that. Um, yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
34:35
34:35
Amazing. So what I'll do, um, is there a chat in this system?
S1
Speaker 1
34:41
34:41
Uh, yeah, there's a chat sort of bottom right little.
S0
Speaker 0
34:44
34:44
Yeah. Lemme gimme a second. Um, so there is an email I sent you. Um, cool. Now what you should do is send me some sort of three page deck or whatever you have, uh, in terms of, you know, telling us about yourself a little bit. Um, and you know, and mentioned that you want to, you know, tap into healthcare somehow, um, et cetera. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Yeah. So I would then connect you with, um, a girl who is in charge of experience. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] a part of our team. Uh, she's based in Vancouver, Canada, so on the west coast Yeah, yeah. Of Amer America. So that's, that's a little bit of a challenge in terms of time zones, but, uh,
S1
Speaker 1
35:35
35:35
Oh, it's fine's the same customer.
S0
Speaker 0
35:39
35:39
Yeah. So, uh, I'll get you in touch with them, uh, and I'll join that meeting too, so that you could actually tell us what, what you, what you do actually, et cetera, et cetera. And we'll see if there is any space for, for, um, for an actual project or something. Um, but I think that's, that's how we can, uh, that's how we can start, uh, if if nothing works out, uh, there, I can get you in contact with a bunch of colleagues across the industry. Yeah. Amazing. Because I know other, I, I know other digital bosses and other companies.
S1
Speaker 1
36:18
36:18
Yeah. It's kind of, it's people focused on innovation. I think that was kind of our differentiator with Google. Like the internal customer ended up winning an innovation award and getting a promotion because he had, you know, we'd delivered this project in partnership with him. It was very different to what they'd done before. And at the end of the day, they fell in love with the ux. They were like, oh, this UX is so simple. Um, why can't we always build our products this way?
S0
Speaker 0
36:42
36:42
So yes. That's what we want. Yeah. Whatever. So I was just thinking while you were, you were, you were talking, uh, I could also connect you with, which might be a little more challenging, but, but anyway, worth trying. Challeng, I can connect you with the actual, um, market research people.
S1
Speaker 1
36:59
36:59
Oh, okay. [crosstalk]. Have you got an, an agency that you partner with on that?
S0
Speaker 0
37:02
37:02
Oh, there is an internal team, first of all, an internal team. Yeah. You can talk to, uh, and then also because Sanofi is, is huge. I mean, that's a massive Yeah, yeah. Massive company. We have, um, essentially three pretty much separate, uh, we call them gbu, global business units. Yeah. Uh, which operate, uh, with completely different types of products. So I am part of, so-called general medicines, which is Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] everything, essentially all the pharma stuff. It's uh, you also can call it just the pharma business. Yeah. Then there is another one which is SFI past, which is vaccines. They only do vaccine business. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], which might not be something, uh, that you, you could go into. I think that's a very, very specific, very government driven kind of operation. Yeah. Uh, and then there is the third one, which is called consumer healthcare. Okay. Uh, which is your, uh, over the counter stuff.
S1
Speaker 1
38:07
38:07
Yeah, yeah. Do they do much field research? Like, uh, are they doing work a lot with like Okay, interesting.
S0
Speaker 0
38:13
38:13
Cool. That, that's essentially your consumer consumer healthcare is is your FMCG.
S1
Speaker 1
38:20
38:20
Okay. That, that's
S0
Speaker 0
38:21
38:21
Exactly the FMCG business with the FMCG business model. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] a lot of TV and internet advertising. Okay. So because this is what, there's a lot of products you can sell without a prescription just in the pharmacy. So this is your normal business general. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so they have way the, the, the bar in terms of regulations is much lower for them. Yeah. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So there you can, in pretty much any market, you can do anything, you can advertise on tv, you can talk to consumers, uh, directly about all of this. You can give 'em samples. I mean, lots of, some things you can do. It's just much more normal kind of business. Yeah. Um, I can connect you with them as well. Uh, and they're, uh, well, they're usually looking for all sorts of new ways of doing stuff because they're just like with FMCG business, they're, they're challenges. They very simple, how do we maximize, uh, our marketing, uh, you know, uh, effects with spending less money. And then, uh, usually you sort of need to dig deeper into the insights and tailor your communications and your product packaging and all the things you can change Yeah. To the needs of those customers across the world. Um, and I obviously know a bunch of people there, so, uh, I can connect with them as well. So we have at least three different,
S1
Speaker 1
39:43
39:43
Three different options, you
S0
Speaker 0
39:44
39:44
Know? Amazing. Thank you. To tap into. Yeah. But the first thing really is just, just send us something, tell us about yourself and then, um, you know, in, in more specifics because it was just an intro call, obviously. And then, uh, and then I'll see how I can um, better connect you with the right people. Um,
S1
Speaker 1
40:06
40:06
That would be amazing. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. And I appreciate your time this morning, so I thank you. It was great to meet you. Yeah. And hopefully we can, uh, meet again.
S0
Speaker 0
40:14
40:14
Yeah. And check out the three by problem I
S1
Speaker 1
40:17
40:17
Worth, I'll check that out. It sounds very intriguing. Alright.
S0
Speaker 0
40:20
40:20
Thank so much. Yeah. Take
S1
Speaker 1
40:22
40:22
Care. Bye-Bye.
S0
Speaker 0
40:23
40:23
Cheers. Bye.

Transcript
Literally, I saw you were on just as I, and then saw you go, and so I thought, well, maybe Yeah. A couple of minutes late. I thought maybe you'd just given up.
S0
Speaker 0
00:09
00:09
No, no, no worries at all. No worries at all. Now I'm just having a bit of a computer malfunction moment, which is tedious. But, uh, anyway, how are you?
S1
Speaker 1
00:16
00:16
I'm good. I'm very good. Thank you. How are you?
S0
Speaker 0
00:18
00:18
I'm very well, thank you. How do you know, um, mark? Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
00:23
00:23
Uh, Mark's. Yeah, Mark's one of my best friends. I mean, I've known him for maybe 10, 12 years, so he Oh, wow. We moved, we moved to the same village at about the same time. Both of our boys are good friends with each other. Oh,
S0
Speaker 0
00:35
00:35
Cool.
S1
Speaker 1
00:36
00:36
And so, yeah, we were, yeah, so we just at the pub every Friday with the kids and they go to the same school, so
S0
Speaker 0
00:43
00:43
Oh,
S1
Speaker 1
00:43
00:43
Very cool. We just became mates.
S0
Speaker 0
00:45
00:45
Nice.
S1
Speaker 1
00:45
00:45
Haven't known him a while. How'd you, how do you know him? Pretty
S0
Speaker 0
00:47
00:47
Cool. Uh, well, he, uh, is part of, uh, one of my VC investors. We just raised finance, uh, at the end of April. Um, and, uh, so yeah, so he was, uh, very kindly introducing me to various people that he thought I might better learn from. So I hope you don't mind, uh, sparing half an hour on those sorts of terms. I appreciate your time.
S1
Speaker 1
01:06
01:06
No, it's a pleasure. It's, thank you. It's a pleasure. I hope I can help. Um, as I said, it's a, we, you know, we, I operate within a, in a very specific kind of disease area, uh, very consumer area. Yeah, yeah. Which is very different from normal, but has a whole series of challenges that we still don't really know how to fix. Yeah. So actually I'm, I'm quite interested to hear what you know, what you know, um, and how that might relate to some of the problems we have as well.
S0
Speaker 0
01:34
01:34
Yeah. Fabulous. Just gimme one second. I think I'm gonna switch back to my laptop now. It seems to have just come back on board, see if it's gonna work. Yes. Okay. Let me just hang, oh, hang up. I'll be back in one second.
S1
Speaker 1
01:46
01:46
No problem.
S0
Speaker 0
01:48
01:48
Hello.
S1
Speaker 1
01:49
01:49
Ah, you're back.
S0
Speaker 0
01:50
01:50
Cool. Let me go. Okay, fabulous. Um, so yeah, let me just, uh, you know, when you've just switched off everything, you're trying to get everything up and running again. Uh, yeah. So, um, yeah. So I've been, uh, quite, quite fortunate over the last year to, um, to, uh, I started a software company, uh, and, uh, we were very lucky to win Google as a first customer, which, um, essentially allowed us to work very closely with their internal research team focused on their qualitative research. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, so they're mainly doing usability studies, which isn't necessarily directly relating to, to what you do, but just really interested to understand, um, yeah, I guess how you use research in the, in the, in your specific disease space and what some of those challenges are, um, to, uh, yeah, to see if, uh, as we develop our product, um, um, you know, it's, it's never, I'm not selling you anything right now.
S0
Speaker 0
02:41
02:41
It's, it's very early, early stages. Um, but I'd love to make sure that we are prepared for, um, being able to help in healthcare longer term, um, in [inaudible], that that may be. Um, so yeah, I'd love to just understand a little bit about, about your space, what you do, what those challenges are. Um, that'd be fantastic. You know, our kind of tagline for now is that we do AI for customer research, um, which is quite broad. We essentially have one customer, which is Google, um, and a few other small people that have, uh, dipped, dipped their toe. Um, and I think what Google found quite useful was just the ability for their researchers to do their qualitative research remotely. Um, you know, they're obviously, they're very global organization, um, and they've got different compliance risks that they have to manage in different, uh, jurisdictions, and that they're very sort of hot on that. So, um, being such an early stage startup, we could, you know, deploy systems into very specific areas and make sure we knew exactly where data was being held and what the retention policies were, and kind of set that up exactly as they needed it. So they got quite a configured, customized solution. Um, but yeah, I mean, tell me a little bit about what you do. You've obviously been involved in with Pfizer and then with Roche and you strictly experienced in this space. Um, yeah,
S1
Speaker 1
03:48
03:48
Yeah. Just before I do, just one quick question. So when, when you talk about research and consumer research Yeah. What, what do you mean? Right, because I, I wanna check we're talking about the same thing because the kind of consumer research that, for example, you might be talking about or that you, that Google needs is very different from the kind of research that we do. So we do market research, we do note pulls. We, we do interviews. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, and, but, but where we have a bit of a black hole is in, in the kind of digital space and knowing how to use that properly, given that we're so heavily regulated in what we're allowed to do and say Yeah. What kind of research we can do with, um, you know, with patients, individuals that are not doctors Exactly. Patients, you know, that the bottom line is we would love to have better relationships with our patients. However, you know, they're always very high risk relationships, particularly when we're doing different sorts of research and we're trying to communicate because that's, yeah. I, i illegal in most countries outside of the US to communicate directly. So w when you talk about research, what, what are, what do you, um, what do you mean?
S0
Speaker 0
04:47
04:47
We're going after market research, uh, in particular, we happen to have started with, um, with Google's particular use case, which is usability studies. And those are essentially interviews with members of the public, um, trying to understand how they use their products and services, um, across a whole different set of products and services. Um, so yeah, really interested to hear about, about the particular challenges in healthcare. Like, I mean, how do you go about how doing patient research, like how does it, how do you even approach it? It sounds like it's quite a challenge.
S1
Speaker 1
05:16
05:16
It is. So, uh, lemme give you a bit of background, right. So I'll tell you a little bit about, um, me and my, my background, what I do now, Mm-Hmm. So I, um, mark's right. I'm, I'm assuming he's sort of shared a little bit of, um, background or you've been, been onto LinkedIn, [laugh]. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but, so I, I did about 18 years at Pfizer, and I've been at Roche now for 10, 12 years. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, I've done a bit of everything, but primarily my, my, my roles over the last 10, 15 years have been, um, kind of general management of disease portfolios, kind of mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, within either UK board or, uh, working for global, uh, the global team. And, and global is really where I'm, I am now. And where I'll probably stay for a while now 'cause it's what I like.
S1
Speaker 1
05:55
05:55
Yeah. Um, I tend to work more in rare diseases, so, Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], spinal muscular atrophy and new gene therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. So, Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, where we have a smaller number of patients, but where the communities themselves are much more integrated, so patient groups, patients Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] doctors rather than something like high blood pressure where, you know, you don't, you know, everybody with high blood pressure doesn't talk to each other and know each other and necessarily join a, um, a patient support group. Mm-Hmm. If one of your children has Duchenne muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy, they, they're like a small family, so Yeah. Outside even of the, of the individual countries that they live in. Mm-Hmm. The, the HCPs, the healthcare professionals tend to know each other. Yeah. A number of, um, therapy area experts tends to be smaller Mm-Hmm. Um, but also patients, patient groups, uh, and healthcare professionals have much closer relationship with their patients.
S1
Speaker 1
06:46
06:46
So, Mm-Hmm. A typical neuromuscular physician, I don't know, they might, you know, if they're a, if they're a specialist neuromuscular, they might have 50 or 60 Duchenne patients. They'll probably know them all and they'll probably have looked after them for, for many, many years. Yeah. Most of those guys will, um, will also be part of patient groups. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So that, that's duchenne on, on spinal muscular atrophy. There's the three versions of spinal muscular atrophy. The more severe one, which is type one, which is kind of deadly if it's not treated before. Mm-Hmm. Age two. Um, and our treatment will stop them from dying, uh, will stop 'em from dying and, and tend to lead to a, effectively a normal life. Yeah. But the biggest opportunity for us is in what's called a type two and type three patients. So these are less severe forms, often aren't diagnosed till later.
S1
Speaker 1
07:30
07:30
Mm-Hmm. And there's a large number of adult patients, um, either in the late teens or twenties and thirties and older, sometimes with, um, neuromuscular development, developmental problems, and, uh, issues. Mm-Hmm. And some of them may choose to be treated, some of them don't choose to be treated. So there's a huge opportunity for us to either treat the patients that have chosen not to be treated for whatever reason, because often 'cause they don't understand Mm-Hmm. Um, they don't understand the benefits or they're already quite disabled and they think, well, what's the point? You know, you know, I kind of pass the point of, um, you know, improving. 'cause the treatments tend to not
S0
Speaker 0
08:07
08:07
Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
08:07
08:07
Make improvements. They just stop getting worse. Right. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
08:10
08:10
Yeah. My wife actually works with, uh, a few Duchenne kids. She's a, she's responsible, she's got a caseload of kids in mainstream education, and she's responsible for arranging a lot of the care and services they need around that, uh, education to try and give them the best. Oh, okay. And she said, so yeah, there's, there's m and d, there's yeah. Some muscular atrophy type stuff as well. Um, but yeah, there's a few Duchenne kids in, in Hampshire, which is sort of the area that she covers. Okay. So, yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
08:33
08:33
Is she a senco then, or,
S0
Speaker 0
08:35
08:35
Uh, she works with all the senco. She's, so she actually is, uh, works for Hampshire County Council. She's a specialist advisor for teacher, uh, for kids with physical disabilities. So she essentially advises all the SCOs, um, through all of the, through a load of different schools, whatever schools the kids are in, um, supports kids as they move from one school to the next to make sure that they've got all of the needs met and services in place. Um, so yeah, she's been doing that for about yeah, a long time. 12 or 13 years now.
S1
Speaker 1
09:00
09:00
And my wife's cinco. That's why I asked. Oh,
S0
Speaker 0
09:02
09:02
There you go.
S1
Speaker 1
09:03
09:03
I wondered when you said, um, so, so we have, so we have this, we would love to know more about, so there's, there's two things. There's older patients. This is with SMA now. So Duchenne is slightly different. 'cause du Duchenne is a gene therapy. Yeah. Um, it will likely be given to boys once when they're between sort of four to eight years old. Mm-Hmm. Um, we'll probably have a label in the uk. Um, but we probably won't have a challenge with people wanting to be treated. 'cause there is no treatment right now. This will be the first gene therapy Mm-Hmm. Um, you know, it has its risks, but fundamentally can, can fix a faulty gene, which can potentially live to a more normal life. It probably isn't a cure, but it is close. The other part of my, uh, job, which is SMA Spinal Muscular Atrophy, as I said, we have these two opportunities.
S1
Speaker 1
09:48
09:48
We have untreated adults or, or untreated older patients with type two and type three, of which there's about 40% of the total population untreated. Yeah. But then we also have a competitor medicine, um, which many patients are still on 'cause it came first mm-Hmm mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, and a lot of patients don't wanna switch across. Right. Even though our treatment, um, doesn't have to be injected in the spine. It's an oral treatment you can take at home. Yeah. Possibly has efficacy benefits as well, depending on who you believe on, on, on how you interpret the science. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, but there are lots of good reasons why most of these people should be looking to switch cross. Many have, we are now the market leader. Yeah. Um, but we still have these two groups of patients, those that are on the existing treatment, and those that are on no treatment that for whatever reason are not being treated.
S1
Speaker 1
10:32
10:32
Yeah. Yeah. We, we do an all, a whole load of research with patients and with, um, and with physicians to fi to figure out why that is. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, most of those are good old fashioned primary research. Right. So sit, sit, sitting down, interviewing neuromuscular physicians and specialists. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] asking a series of questions, responding to stimuli. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, same thing with the patients. Just, just, you know, series of questions. Are you treated? Yes. No. Yeah. And once, once they passed the screening, you know, we asked them a lot about things like when they, when they were treated, how did they decide on what treatment, you know, what did they make the decision? How well informed were they? Yeah. Yeah. What advice of the doctor, what did the doctor say to them? Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, what, what, what effectively made the final decision? Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. So we do some of that's primary research. Some of that's done as questionnaires online. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, but the
S0
Speaker 0
11:21
11:21
Majority. And does that, is that, is that a research team that's within Roche? Or is that something that you outsource to partners? Um, you know, we're just, yeah. So we're just building a, a solution to support those, uh, you know, to be a technology provider to those sorts of, of, of research agencies that it sounds like you would use, um, to gather those sorts of insights. Um, so I'm trying to put together like a, an advisory board of, of some sort people that are really interested in how we can legally use AI to actually accelerate, um, you know, the coding and the tagging of the qualitative research that they're doing to accelerate the report writing so that you can get your insights back into the, the business much, much faster. Um, because it is a, a time consuming human labor intensive process.
S1
Speaker 1
12:02
12:02
Um, uh, and it's expensive, you know, I think that Yeah. You know, it, uh, on, on on my p and LI would say that, um, I mean, I don't control the p and l for, for re So the, the way we operate is you have two global general managers if you like. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], you have the strategic general manager, uh, and they deal with this, you know, the, the headline strategy Mm-Hmm. Uh, and which requires the research. And then you have the operational general manager, which is like what I do. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] I'm responsible for, for the hundred affiliates. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], I'm responsible for inputting in and being part of the core strategy team. Yeah. Um, but the strategy sort of director is, is responsible. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], I'm responsible for making sure that that strategy is then taken to a hundred different countries and they act upon it and, and work up tactical plans and deliver on them.
S1
Speaker 1
12:47
12:47
Um, and then feedback into the strategy. And so, and so it goes round. So between the two of us, if you like, we are the two bosses. Yeah. It's the easiest way of thinking about it. We're the two, the two kind of general managers of the, of the brand. And that's marketing medical access, which is getting reimbursement for medicines and so on. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] and everything else. Um, but we deal with medicines, you know, once they're past the research stage when prior to launch. So we reach a point called pgo, which is when pivotal trials will start. And at the point we know that we are having a phase three pivotal trial. That's when the kind of more the commercial team would take over. Yeah. Which is, which is when they would set up, uh, an I squad, which is what we are. Uh, and we look after these two brands and we've, and we've looked after them since the, the first final major clinical trial.
S1
Speaker 1
13:31
13:31
Okay. We started about four years ago. Yeah. We've been in the market with one medicine for three years. The second medicine for gene therapy. We're just waiting for regulatory approval for EMA from European medicines as, uh, association authority. Sorry. Um, and, and then we'll be launching there. But there is, we are now at a very competitive stage within SMA. So our major competitor, which is Biogen, which is, which is another big company. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, are a very aggressive marketing company as Pfizer were when I worked there. Roche is a far more scientific Swiss conservative Yeah. Uh, company. Um, and, and the way we train our, um, customer facing colleagues Mm-Hmm. We don't call them sales rep. These are the sales rep. Are
S0
Speaker 0
14:11
14:11
They the affiliates? You mentioned
S1
Speaker 1
14:13
14:13
The affiliates. Yeah. So we have, so we, we would have in, in a big affiliate, we might have five or six people working just exclusively on neuromuscular disease. Mm-Hmm. Uh, in smaller affiliates, we might only have one or two. And in, in very small affiliates, we might have one person working across three or four different countries. Mm-Hmm. But you would usually have a marketeer in the country as well. Someone who's responsible for access, someone's responsible, you know, for all the medical and, and safety reporting and so on. Yeah. Yeah. All, all of those guys kind of, they're report into their country, but they're fundamentally part of the group that we, that we look after and manage. Yeah. Yeah. So we're encouraging them via sort of some more old fashioned methods to be a little bit more competitive. So to think about how they can challenge a little bit more, um, aggressively is the wrong word, a little bit more robustly. Mm-Hmm. Um, and to get very heavily involved in the conversation that they have with the, the physician Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
15:03
15:03
As it relates to the conversation the physician has with the patient. So in other words, rather than just saying, here's the medicine, this is how it works, we now know from research we've done Mm-Hmm. That there's a, it seems like most physicians feel like they're presenting their patients with one of these two options. Mm-Hmm. Well, one of three options, really. The original treatment, our treatment or no treatment. Yeah. And patients choose on the basis of that conversation, patients tell us. Yeah. That quite often their doctor guided them to one treatment or another. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], a lot of doctors tell us they're often them a fair choice and, and present them equally. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's good. And there's a bit of a mismatch because Yeah. Yeah. Doctors probably think they're presenting an equal choice, but they have their own personal biases, which I think they find it hard to Yeah,
S0
Speaker 0
15:47
15:47
Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
15:48
15:48
Hard to eliminate when, when they're having these discussions. So,
S0
Speaker 0
15:51
15:51
And so is there, is there a certain amount of research that you do on the physicians and the nature of the physicians' conversations as well? Or, or, yeah. Okay. Great. Um, and so who, who's responsible for that research? Like, who would be, uh, who would come to mind if I asked? Like, you know, who, who's your superstar researcher? Do you see what I mean? Like, what is the
S1
Speaker 1
16:09
16:09
Companywide companywide again?
S0
Speaker 0
16:11
16:11
Sorry.
S1
Speaker 1
16:12
16:12
From a company perspective?
S0
Speaker 0
16:13
16:13
Yeah, well, from your perspective. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
16:16
16:16
Well, that's what I meant. In internally or externally. So from, from an external point of view, we, we have a panel of about half a dozen by we, I mean, Roche has a panel of, uh, of approved kind of marketers, and they go through the whole procurement process and Sure. Agreed terms. Um, but we don't, we don't have one individual, um, research we use, well probably even 10. Um, and across the 13, so, so I'm only one of about 13 franchises. Um, Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And of those 12 or 13 franchises, they may all use different researchers. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
16:46
16:46
And often that's based on past relationships, um, based on their experience in particular disease areas. Yeah. Um, and sometimes just because some of them claim to specialize in ethnographic or anthropological style research or have, you know, we usually, we usually ask three companies. We usually take the panel that we have Yeah. And we ask three of those companies to pitch. Yeah. And then we choose one of those pitches. And within me and Martin's team, we have, we have an individual who is our market research leader. She's called the insights lead. Yeah. So, and she leads on all sorts of insights, primary secondary research. Mm-Hmm. Um, she also brings in competitive intelligence and so on. And it's, it's her job to present back all of the data. So we've just recently had, um, like a third wave, um, kind of post-launch, primary market research, looking at what physicians think and patients think that's just been presented back now.
S1
Speaker 1
17:42
17:42
Now we, we pay hundreds of thousands of pounds for that. Some, sometimes millions. You know, I think that, uh, and if there was a more efficient way of doing that, you know, we'd love to know about it. The other thing, Dave, which is really, which is a very interesting kind of development that's going on within, uh, our organization as a whole, is I've just been involved for the last couple of weeks in Switzerland in a, in a kind of a redesign of the way we are commercially set up now without going into all the detail of that Mm-Hmm. The bit that's relevant here is that we have insights people dotted around all over the place. Right. So we have insights, people that work for our access department, our reimbursement insights, people that work in our data department, insights, people that work for the individual brands and franchises.
S1
Speaker 1
18:25
18:25
Mm-Hmm. Insights, people that work for our policy and healthcare, all kind of overlapping in the kind of research that they do. Yeah. Yeah. One of the recommendations that we made was to bring all this group together into a single kind of data and insights department. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, so that, A, there's less duplication, but b we can make sure that we can, we can bring in insights from all different, all different channels can bring in research. Yeah. And then the other thing we have is we have, uh, uh, a customer management system or, you know, the customer, customer relationship management system Mm-Hmm. Which is now coordinated across, or, or, um, aligned across all of our different countries or most of them Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And so now every time they, our customer facing colleagues see doctors, for example, and then type in comments and so on.
S1
Speaker 1
19:13
19:13
Yep. We have a tool which does use AI to actually go, to go through, there could be 5,000 comments that were made over the last two months Yep. And it goes through them all and summarizes the five key points that Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] come from 5,000 different coming in about two seconds. Yeah. Yeah. Which we found super useful. And I think that our thinking now is, and, and, and a massive hot topic within Roche and many other drug companies is Yeah. How can we get, you know, we are, we're, we are very analog when it comes to the way that we do research. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], it's very much talking to folk, um, doing a little bit of, uh, social media kind of insights gathering, you know, through, through watching what people are saying on different website.
S0
Speaker 0
19:56
19:56
Yeah. Social media listening. Yeah,
S1
Speaker 1
19:57
19:57
Exactly. Social media listening, gathering information that way. Gathering information from CRM, gathering information from individuals Mm-Hmm. But we are not very good, uh, at this whole kind of interpretation and omnichannel part, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Fucking big loads of information in working out exactly what it means. Using different channels and figuring out how to then deliver a more targeted message Mm-Hmm. To patient archetypes or, Mm-Hmm. Doctor archetypes. Yeah. Uh, it's all a little bit blunderbuss, I
S0
Speaker 0
20:27
20:27
Would say. Yeah. Yeah. And just I'm interested in that kind of insights lead internally. Um, presumably they have a huge amount of, um, you know, Roche related knowledge that it actually comes down to their interpretation. Presumably the external research agencies can only get so far, and then somebody internally really has to be able to actually direct a lot of that analysis. Yeah. Um, you know, what we're trying to develop is this kind of, this personalized researcher superpower ai. Do you see what I mean? Because it needs to be trained on what they know to be able to apply the right context and therefore pull out the right insights. Because, you know, anybody can ask an AI these days based on 5,000 comments, the the wrong question [laugh]. Um, and so we're actually trying to develop a way to, um, to, to train the AI and personalize the AI around particular researchers because it's the expertise that they bring, um, that kind of provides the, the real additional value. Um, does that make sense? Does that, does that ring true for you? Or you, I mean, it could know the insights Dunno,
S1
Speaker 1
21:29
21:29
[laugh] It could do. I th I mean, I don't even know if it relies upon quite right now. I would say that the, the way that we gather insights is too disparate for any one single thing to read through it all as, as an AI and make, I think the, the, the first thing we need to do is to get our shit together and get all of the kind of different insight levels that we have Mm-Hmm. Um, pulled together in one place so that something could analyze it. And, and that's what I don't for, for now. We still operate very much within disease areas and disease teams. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], uh, there are a lot of insights that sit, uh, at a more macro level just within healthcare, for example, or within countries or within areas Yeah. Um, that we really should be able to overlay, which we can't Mm-Hmm.
S1
Speaker 1
22:12
22:12
Or depending on who you are. So let's say we can, but, you know, we don't, we don't do it. We the level of sophistication that a lot of consumer companies would do. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and part of that is because we can't gather information through the normal tools. So we can look at, we can do the social media listening Mm-Hmm. But we don't, can't do social media listening really with doctors and, you know, we can't ever advertise. I mean, it's not, it's, it's not just unethical Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], you know, we, we, me would go to prison if I, if I did anything, which mentioned a drug name to a patient directly, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. So, so there, we, we are governed by a set of rules that, you know, where we are so restricted in what we can ask. 'cause we can't ever ask about an individual treatment.
S1
Speaker 1
22:54
22:54
We just have to ask general questions. And so that makes it hard for us to draw Mm-Hmm. Uh, draw conclusions. We can ask more direct questions in consumer research where, you know, where they have given explicit permission for us to, to do the research and we're paying them. Yeah. Yeah. But again, you're only, you're only often looking at a subset of patients then. Yeah. And, and it's not, it's not the same as Google gathering hundreds of millions of pieces of data and putting it through ai AI to solve a challenge. Yeah. We have a much smaller cohort. Yeah. Don't forget that we also have oncology, we also have neurology, we also have ophthalmology. We also have a load of other disease areas, um, which are much bigger. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, and each of these would, would benefit in different ways from a different approach. And then you have the macro level, which is kinda like healthcare trends in countries and areas and so on. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], which would overlay on top of what's happening with different disease areas, which would all be useful to try and pull together into some kind of cohesive statement. We use IMSA lot, you know, we use, um, salesforce.com a lot. Yeah. Um, tho those, those are our kind of big data providers. Yeah. Um, and we, as I said, we use a whole variety of different market research companies, most of whom are kind of, uh, agencies of, you know, a OR for us Mm-Hmm. So, um, yeah, it, it
S0
Speaker 0
24:12
24:12
Amazing. No, that's, that's a fantastic insight
S1
Speaker 1
24:14
24:14
A bit. It's still a little bit disparate, Dave. So, you know, I'd love to say this one way we do it, we just don't do it in one way.
S0
Speaker 0
24:20
24:20
No, I definitely see the, the complexity of healthcare in particular being a kind of three to five year journey, uh, for us to even get through the door, just because of some of the, the complexity there. Um, uh, in terms of like, do you have an idea of what the insight, what type of insights they are that you feel like you're missing either from doctors or patients? Or is it that you feel like you must be missing something because of the nature of the, the disparate, um, and the overlaps and, um, the fact that the Yeah. There's all these different sort of silos that the research and insights are happening in?
S1
Speaker 1
24:53
24:53
Well, what I, I, this is a personal view, right. So, um, I think if you ask most people within our industry, they would say that actually our insights are pretty good. Mm-Hmm. Um, because, because we've always been good at doing primary market research and paying a lot of money for it. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, but I always sense with, with any of the research that we do, Mm-Hmm. By definition you end up, whether it's, whether it's online questionnaires or whether it's interviews Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], there's, there's often only certain sorts of doctors that get involved in that. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, often I feel that they, they have a good sense of who, who is running the, uh, research Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And I always feel it's slightly biased towards more positive and more of what we want to hear than less of what we wanna hear. Yeah. Trust,
S0
Speaker 0
25:39
25:39
Trust issue. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
25:40
25:40
Yeah. So there's a bit of that. Yeah. Um, but the, the, the, the bit that I think is the major, the major gap across all healthcare right now Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] is, is a true understanding of the impact of the patient, um, choice. Right. So what is it that they're going, so, so if you go back 20 years, you know, people would go to their doctor and say, I've got this, this hurts. Mm-Hmm. Doctor would say, you've got this problem. Mm-Hmm. And here's the medicine that you need. Right? Yeah. Nowadays, most people might follow that first stage where they say, I'm, I feel a bit weak. What's wrong with me? You run a few tests and they say, this is, this is what you've got. Yeah. We'll talk about it. They go back, consult Dr. Google, thank you, mark [laugh], uh, consult, consult Dr. Google, uh, look at all the treatments, go on to patient websites and groups and go back to the doctor often with a relative or whatever, and have a discussion, you know, about treatment.
S1
Speaker 1
26:33
26:33
Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And so we've always regarded our healthcare professionals as being our primary customers. Yeah. Um, and I now, I feel strongly, and not everyone agrees with me in the industry, but I feel strongly that nowadays the impact of that patient voice and that consumer, and it's, you know, the end user Yeah. Yeah. Uh, is far more important than we ever credit for. And yet we invest less and less and less money really in understanding Yeah. What it is that they want, what it is they're finding out what their concerns are. Lemme give you, lemme give you an example. Um, so I've already mentioned with, for our smma treatment. Yeah. We, uh, so we're just about to produce a tablet form of, of, of the oral. So the oral treatment we have now is like a liquid Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], we're about to produce a tablet.
S1
Speaker 1
27:21
27:21
Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, and the other treatment, the original treatment is a spinal injection, which you have to have every three or four months. Okay. Um, they both work, they both work pretty well. They're both well thought of. Um, and the, and the tablet form will, doesn't need to be kept in the fridge. It, you can travel with it and all the rest of it. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], I still don't think we really understand what difference does that make, you know? Yeah, yeah. We're talking about doesn't need to be refrigerated. You can travel with it, you know, um, you don't need to take time off school. Um, when you start what, however, I would like to get to a a point where we, we really understand what are the kind of inherent drivers of why someone would choose one treatment over another. What difference does it really make to their life?
S1
Speaker 1
28:06
28:06
Mm-Hmm. Um, why would someone choose not to be treated? Yeah. Yeah. And, and get under the skin of that, right? Mm-Hmm. Because that for me is we can then, we can then talk to our customer facing roles to say and inform our marketing around Okay, within in that context, how do we change the kind of narrative and discussion that we are having Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] about the tablet, rather than to just talk about the features of what a tablet provides. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Talk about it in, in, through the, through the lens of what is it about your patients that you can offer them with this tablet. Yeah, yeah. That make you a better doctor. Yeah. Yeah. And how can you have that conversation with them Mm-Hmm. Rather than just talking about features of the tablet itself. Mm-Hmm. And that's the bit that I just don't think, whether it's this disease area or others, what you really have a good idea about.
S1
Speaker 1
28:55
28:55
Um, and, and that's only going in one direction, right? Yeah. So there will come a, there will come a stage where, um, I mean, and, and don't forget the UK's a bad example because the UK has the NHS, which is all paid for and so on. Yeah. Yeah. In the US we already see this as much more of a trend of people demand certain medicines and certain levels of quality and so on, which is why they charge more for drugs because mm-Hmm. They know that there's a consumer demand that drives it. Mm-Hmm. And doctors are not brave enough to tell their patients no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whereas in the UK, they have nice and one or two other things and they can just say, no, we're not giving you that. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm thinking globally here, if, if you, if, if you, that, that patient demand is increasing, that importance of, um, customer preference at a patient level, end user is increasing. And our ability to, to gather those insights and apply them in marketing and customer facing opportunities Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] is, is not growing at the same rate that that opportunity is presenting itself.
S0
Speaker 0
29:50
29:50
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Um, thank you very much. I realize we're just over time. Um, what, so I've just been given $1.3 million, uh, sort of pre-seed investment, uh, to build the future of qualitative research. So, uh, very excited. I'm a solo founder. Um, if there was one thing that you would suggest I do, or one place to start, uh, in terms of, uh, accelerating my speed to understanding the healthcare space, um, what would you, what might you suggest?
S1
Speaker 1
30:21
30:21
Gosh, that's a very good question. Um, I, I, I mean, I think you're doing the right thing, first of all by, by figuring out what's already out there, right? Yeah. There, there's, there are a lot of people with their fingers in this pie. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
30:32
30:32
Yeah. I mean, I, QIA seems to be the market leader. They turn over sort of 15 billion a year. Yeah. I, you know, garner turns over 5 billion in a totally different industry. Um,
S1
Speaker 1
30:41
30:41
So it's, the IMS that I mentioned is, is IQI iqvia? I'm, I'm just using, well, IMS was bought by, I iqvia
S1
Speaker 1
30:47
30:47
Into IQ mm-Hmm. So, so I still use old language 'cause I'm, 'cause I'm still old school, but IQA is what I'm talking about. Yeah, yeah. There, there we use them a lot. But there are a lot of, um, in internationally based classical market research company that specializes in healthcare Mm-Hmm. That become a OR for different drug companies and get used over and over and over again. Mm-Hmm. Um, using fairly traditional old, old fashioned methods. So I think you need to understand what you can offer that's different to them. That's, that's, yeah. Yeah. 'cause the hard thing is, is getting in, getting in with a, getting in with a company, and I would suggest not trying to go toe toe, toe to toe with these guys.
S0
Speaker 0
31:25
31:25
No. I think we would actually empower them. We'd provide the technology that would actually accelerate their use cases. Do you see what I mean? Because it's such a niche specialism. Um, we couldn't possibly, um, yeah. We couldn't possibly complete compete. I I sort of see us trying to power them or develop the AI systems that power what they need.
S1
Speaker 1
31:43
31:43
Yeah. So, so I I I see, I see two major opportunities, right? Mm. For me, there's an opportunity which you've already talked about, which is working out who the big players are within market. And, and I would focus on the bigger companies, right? So top, top 20 pharma companies. Mm-Hmm. And whi, which are the AOLs that they use, you know, which are the big agencies that they use for market research. Mm-Hmm. And for data as well, which is mainly IQVA for most people. Mm-Hmm. But that tends, IQVA tends to provide, um, tends to provide data on sort of demographics and sales and market research, sorry, market shares and, you know, like, like classic sales data. Yeah. Uh, as, as well as kind of demographic ages and stuff like that. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, so when, when, when we have to do, we have to do a lot of, uh, forecasting and when we forecast we need, we need to understand exactly, you know, what the number of patients are.
S1
Speaker 1
32:33
32:33
And again, I-Q-V-I-R off often helps us with some of that stuff. Mm-Hmm. Um, so the first thing would be yeah. Supporting these agencies across the board to be better at providing more, uh, quicker Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] and more insightful, uh, at insightful looks at that patient and doctor relationship and patient choice Yeah. As an end user for being a patient, but also a better idea across a broader spectrum of people with healthcare professionals. 'cause at the moment, we, we base all of our decisions on 20 or 30 specialists, which get interviewed Yeah, yeah, yeah. In one, in one of four or five big countries. Yeah. And then apply that to 90 different countries. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], if there's a way of being able to get ideas and experience from different archetypes of markets and to compare and contrast different points of view Mm-Hmm. That would be a super good, much more powerful, much more helpful for us.
S1
Speaker 1
33:24
33:24
Mm-Hmm. But you're right. Not, not to try and take them on head to head support, support, their ability to do that and do that more quickly and across a, a larger group of people would be, would be fantastic. Mm-Hmm. The second thing, which, which I think is an opportunity internally in some of the big companies, is every big company right now, well, certainly all the ones that I know of or speak to Mm-Hmm. Is desperate to improve its internal ability to, um, pull together data sources and analyze them themselves. Right? Yeah. So whe and that's data, right? So whether that's data from social media, data from sales, data from doctors, data from market research, data from insights across from our, from our customer facing roles. Hmm. Anything try trying to pull this together into one place and make sense of it in, in a, in an efficient way is what we're all trying to do.
S1
Speaker 1
34:17
34:17
And then also to think about how you use that in preparing for an omnichannel strategy. So how do you therefore decide, okay, for this archetype Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], uh, of doctor or patient, we need to primarily use social media and it needs to say this Yeah. But this group of patients, we primarily need to invite them to big meetings where we support them and give them education on this. Yeah. And we follow it up with this. And then the, the second follow up is with something else. Right. And then they get called on by a rep and so on. So being able to understand the archetypes across our main customer groups, both healthcare professionals and patients. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] be able to accumulate data and, and format an omnis omnichannel strategy. Yeah. Is is the goal of every pharma company right now? Yeah. Yeah. At the moment we are throwing, you know, we do, we do medical congresses, we have reps, you know, of different shapes and sizes, medical specialists.
S1
Speaker 1
35:14
35:14
Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And, and we're dominated by an old fashioned kind of face-to-face way of dealing. And that's just not the way that many doctors are consuming information. And we occasionally send them an email and we set up the odd website. Mm-Hmm. But it's just, you know, it's, it's nothing like would be done by a decent consumer company now. Yeah. So for me, those are the two opportunities. Something you, you could do to speed up what research is being done. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And then a second opportunity to think about how a, how AI could be used with the research that we get across the board and the data to come up with some omnichannel solutions for different archetypes.
S0
Speaker 0
35:50
35:50
That's really helpful. That's second opportunity in particular because I've been trying to, under trying to imagine like, how do we turn this into action? Like how do we turn that insight into an action that's useful instantly? Do you see what I mean? It's great being able to use AI to surface insights, but so what then what, what comes next? How does it actually, um, how does it actually act out in the world? That's incredibly helpful. Just one quick last question then, um, on the first opportunity, do the research agencies primarily discharge for their time and so they're gonna be quite anti something that speeds up their process? Um, or no,
S1
Speaker 1
36:22
36:22
Not really. No. Not really. I mean, no. Okay.
S1
Speaker 1
36:26
36:26
I mean, it, it being brutally honest, you know, like the way that, uh, so, so they, they agree fees Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, as part of the procurement process when they become an A OR. Yeah. Um, and often we get numbers back from them that I'm sure they just pluck out. Excuse my, they pluck 'em outta the fucking air. I mean, you know, they, they look at the size of the company, the importance of the disease area, the opportunity that might exist. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and if you're a big company with lots of money and working on a brand that's gonna make a fortune Yeah. And you're well respected. Yeah. They come up with a number. Yeah. Uh, fundamentally it's based upon what kind of research they do. So if it's face-to-face, it's more expensive and the number of people that they interview Mm-Hmm. You know, broadly it's in line with that Mm-Hmm.
S1
Speaker 1
37:10
37:10
Um, but it's not like how many hours it is in the sense that they charge for, but, but we prepare the, the, the stimuli and the questionnaires really in, in collaboration with them because they don't know always about the, they don't have the level of knowledge and the medical knowledge on the disease area. Yeah. We have to work with them on that. Mm-Hmm. Or rather the insights the leads do. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], uh, they then do all that research. Sometimes we sit and watch in Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] and or do ad boards or something Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And then they go away into a dark room and come back with 200 slides. Yeah,
S0
Speaker 0
37:41
37:41
Yeah. Got it.
S1
Speaker 1
37:42
37:42
Show and, and present it to us. And then, um, we then present it usually to our whole sort of Salesforce and to our global teams in different countries and say, here's what we learned last week. Mm. Um, but again, it's usually based on 30 or 40 if we're lucky a hundred docs that, that were interviewed for half an hour each. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
38:01
38:01
Yeah. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
38:02
38:02
And we do that in waves every sort of six months or so.
S0
Speaker 0
38:05
38:05
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Cool. Oh, amazing. Thank
S1
Speaker 1
38:08
38:08
You. So speed. Speeding up. Speeding up for them. They would charge the same, I'm sure.
S0
Speaker 0
38:12
38:12
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. So
S1
Speaker 1
38:14
38:14
Even if it saved them 20% and they could come back to us and say, well we can save you 10% 'cause we've got this new AI solution. Yeah. 10% better off. Right.
S0
Speaker 0
38:22
38:22
Exactly. With their sales process anyway.
S1
Speaker 1
38:27
38:27
But we do, but at pharma companies, you know, we do like our a hundred or 200 slide decks from market research companies,
S0
Speaker 0
38:32
38:32
[laugh]. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
38:33
38:33
Make them feel like they've earned their money when we've paid them, have paid them half a million. Qui.
S0
Speaker 0
38:36
38:36
Yeah. Absolutely. [laugh]. Cool. Alright. Brilliant. Well thank you so much. I, I really appreciate your time and, and going over time as well. Thank you. That
S1
Speaker 1
38:43
38:43
That's fine as it happens. My next call at two, so, uh, you, you, you locked down on that one. [laugh] I'll need to eat now. David, if, if you are interested, uh, when you maybe got a bit more idea of what you want to, what your, what you wanna do, what your offering might be. Mm-Hmm. It just so happens that one of my sort of old colleagues on the UK board Yeah. Um, when he, he left and went into kind of data and insights Okay. And he's now the head of that group globally. Oh wow. Um, and so he's, and he's put someone I've been working with on in the kind of way that we are restructuring right now. Mm. He's English guy, really nice bloke. Yeah. And uh, I'm pretty sure if I twisted his arm and just said, look, will you speak to this guy for half an hour? He might say no. Yeah. Yeah. But I would, I would certainly speak to him because also if we were looking at a kind of global vendor at any point in the future to help Yeah, yeah. Think about omnichannel solutions. Yeah. Um, he would be the guy that, you know, that's what keeps him awake at night. Yeah. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
39:38
39:38
Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
39:38
39:38
And, and as long as you mention omnichannel every other word and how you can apply AI for omnichannel. Yeah. It might just get an in and Okay,
S0
Speaker 0
39:45
39:45
Cool.
S1
Speaker 1
39:46
39:46
You know, and then Mark, then Marco lo me beer as an investor.
S0
Speaker 0
39:49
39:49
Definitely.
S1
Speaker 1
39:50
39:50
And I'll not mention that I've got any kind of skin in the game,
S0
Speaker 0
39:54
39:54
[laugh]. No, absolutely not. Uh, yeah, no, an introduction there.
S1
Speaker 1
39:57
39:57
I wasn't doing a friend a favor.
S0
Speaker 0
39:58
39:58
No, exactly. Um, no. And yeah, an introduction there would be, sounds like it'd be amazing. Yeah. Great.
S1
Speaker 1
40:04
40:04
I wouldn't do it right now be, but if you, if you get to the point where you, you've come up with some sort of a, an offering or a proposal. Yeah, yeah. Uh, it only needs to be maybe a couple of steps on from where you are now, but I, I can, I can, I'm pretty sure I can sell it to him. I'll see him in Basel in a few weeks time. And I'll just say this really interesting guy. Yeah, yeah. Works, works with Google. Google on ai, kinda omnichannel solutions. I'll say that for research. Um, he's trying to think about how that can be used in healthcare and we could be like the first healthcare company to be, to be doing a Google like project. Yeah, yeah. Because those are the sorts of things that would land well internally. 'cause we fancy ourselves as being
S0
Speaker 0
40:41
40:41
The
S1
Speaker 1
40:41
40:41
Google, but we're not. And so if we could do something that had that kind of tone or link, I'm sure that would go down well.
S0
Speaker 0
40:49
40:49
Hmm. Amazing. Brilliant. Alright, I will come back to you in a couple of months. Appreciate it. Good luck. Drop

Oh, hello? Hello.
S1
Speaker 1
03:07
03:07
Hey, Dave, how are you?
S2
Speaker 2
03:09
03:09
I'm very well, thank you. How are you? Good to meet you.
S1
Speaker 1
03:12
03:12
I'm fine. Thanks a lot. Yeah, likewise. Very nice to meet you.
S2
Speaker 2
03:16
03:16
Excellent. So I see you're based at CSG?
S1
Speaker 1
03:18
03:18
Yes, yes. I'm, I'm based in CSG. Have you been here before?
S2
Speaker 2
03:22
03:22
Uh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. A number of times over the years actually. Um, you've got a new floor or something, right? A new, you've taken on some new bits of it? I don't think I've seen the new parts.
S1
Speaker 1
03:31
03:31
Yeah. Yeah. We have some, taken some new parts. There is a new restaurant floor, let's say, [laugh]. Nice. Which is quite popular. Uh, yeah. I think like they are trying to consolidate some other offices in this one.
S2
Speaker 2
03:44
03:44
Mm-Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. Nice. So, uh, tell me a bit about yourself. Um, yeah. What you do and, you know, how did you Yeah. How did you find us? Like what, what prompted you to reach out?
S1
Speaker 1
03:54
03:54
Sure, sure. Um, so I work as a, uh, global marketing manager in Google. Um, I'm, I specifically work on at the intersection of Google Ads and ai. So I, most of my work is around how we can bring all the new AI technology that Google Engineers are working on to Google ads space, specifically towards, you know, uh, acquisition of SMBs for Google Ads, uh, sometimes to, uh, work on, I'll say more future focused use cases. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, to be honest, I don't have a specific use case when I reach out to you because, you know, on the website it says, Hey, like, enter your website to create a personalized demo. I, I hit my email and here we are. So I'm, uh, but I'm always curious, right? Uh, I, I like to explore things. I like to see, you know, what startups are, are up to and just to, you know, keep thinking on this front, right. Because lot of my work involves around creating new use cases, ideation. So yeah. I'm, I'm just genuinely curious about, uh, what beings is all about.
S2
Speaker 2
05:03
05:03
Oh, cool. Um, and so tell me a little bit about, like, like how do you go about your, your kind of customer research at the moment? Are there, do you use some of the, the platforms that are out there already?
S1
Speaker 1
05:15
05:15
So, yeah, either I think we use, um, some agencies that are already validated in our, you know, rooster. Um, user testing.com is very popular. I'll say. I'm not, I don't, I don't use a lot, but it's popular because it's small cell service. Mm-Hmm. Um, and, and that was actually one of my questions that we can maybe, like, you can enlighten me later on, like, um, where does your startup slash product fit in across to many, I think different range of, you know, research, you know, product and agencies, but I will say we lean into more traditional research, plus I will say a bit of user testing depending on how fast you want to go.
S2
Speaker 2
06:00
06:00
Yeah. Gotcha. And so are you actually doing that research for yourself? Are you actually a user of, of user testing or do you tend to do it through, um, UX researchers specifically in your teams?
S1
Speaker 1
06:11
06:11
Through through UX researchers mainly.
S2
Speaker 2
06:13
06:13
Yeah. Cool. Um, so we did a project, uh, with UXI last year, the UX infrastructure team. Um, so working with, uh, Andrew Ferris, um, and Andrew Bridges also from, he was from a different team. He was more from like the AV kind of the, you know, the UX labs environments that they are. Um, and so we did a project looking at those labs and looking at how to, uh, I guess replace those labs because they're due to be, uh, end of life at the end of this year, so they're gonna be closed down. Yeah. Um, so we looked at building a, and we built a prototype for them of a, a mobile research lab, um, so that the research could be conducted absolutely anywhere. Um, at the time they had a few kind of use cases. We focused on one for the Ware OS team, uh, looking at how to, how they would do, uh, mobile research on the Fitbit watch.
S2
Speaker 2
07:05
07:05
Um, and we looked at, you know, fairly straightforward kind of apps studies on mobile devices again, um, how they would do, um, uh, an app study, you know, to understand how a user is using an app running on a mobile device. Um, and the, the brief was they wanted to escape those labs. So, you know, how do they do research out in the real world? Um, I think the brief from the, the global head of UX was, I want to be able to do research in Starbucks. I want be to do research in a remote Indian village to understand a much more diverse, uh, set of their, of users, um, of, of your products and services. Um, so that's kind of what we worked on with them. Um, and, uh, we, we essentially built a prototype, uh, and then tried it out on a lot of their internal research teams. So that kind of, that centralized research team. But my understanding actually is that that research team has been moved out into different areas of the business now, um, and isn't necessarily like a single centralized team. Um, does Google Ads have its own dedicated UX researchers as part of your teams, or, or how are you?
S1
Speaker 1
08:09
08:09
Yeah, I think it's all distributed. I will say being honest with you. So I think like, um, yes, there are, like, we have like centralized, I will say UX slash research experts. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. Um, but they can only accommodate so much. They can only reserve a given number of, you know, research Mm-Hmm. Um, and some, sometimes there are like individual teams who like to conduct research, but they don't have [inaudible]. Right. But they, you need to go fast, so what do they do? Yeah. So it are centralized teams. Mm-Hmm. But the system is not centralized. Everybody at has it tries to find their own way depending on their use case.
S2
Speaker 2
08:45
08:45
Yeah, for sure. Are you aware of, um, of recall one of the internal tools at, at Google
S1
Speaker 1
08:51
08:51
Recall? No, I'm not. I'm not familiar.
S2
Speaker 2
08:54
08:54
Um, so about a year and a half ago it was, um, identified that, uh, a very large number of research was taking place on third party tools. Yeah. Um, and because of that, there was an increased, uh, GDPR risk, um, because a lot of the time they're doing research on members of the public. Uh, and obviously if any of that kind of PII, any of that person identifiable information is leaked, um, then it just, it, it increases that risk and, and the, the level of finds that Google becomes, uh, exposed to. Yeah. Um, and so the, and one of the steering committees, one of the research based steering committees, I can't remember its name, um, uh, essentially mandated that all research, all video research content should end up in recall, which is an internal repository, um, an internal video repository within, within Google. And it's managed by, um, constellation, which is again, one of the core ux, um, one of the, it's a UX sort of support team that's, that's run by core. Um, so they've got quite a, we've worked quite closely with them and they've got quite a good tool for, um, for bringing in a lot of that research. It may be worth, um, taking a little look at that. If you want, I can introduce you to, um, uh, to one of the, one of them with Andrew there that we've been working with for the last little while. Um, he could probably share some of that with you, um,
S1
Speaker 1
10:14
10:14
You know, interesting. Yeah. I think like we are, so we are in a marketing organization. I think the folks you mentioned, I don't like product organization. Yes,
S2
Speaker 2
10:21
10:21
That's right. Uh,
S1
Speaker 1
10:22
10:22
And different folks have like total different players of managing. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't even aware, you know, of this one. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll definitely research though.
S2
Speaker 2
10:30
10:30
Yeah, definitely check it out. Um, what we are looking to do is build an integration with our platform into recall so that all of that video content doesn't stay in a third party tool, but actually goes and flows straight into that recall system. Again, just, just for Google Security, um, you know, at the moment, you know, we run on Google Cloud, um, unlike most of the other platforms out there, most of the other platforms run on, on AWS. Um, and we're building integrations with, uh, with Gemini to use the natural language processing to review the transcripts from all of the recordings that get done on our system, um, to hopefully kind of speed up that, uh, the ability to get the insights out of those, um, outta those research studies. Um, so just tell me a little bit about like a, a sort of standard study for you. Like what, what is it that you're trying to understand? Is it, um, you're, are you trying to understand from small businesses how they currently use the, the existing Google Ads platform? And what ways you might kind of introduce AI into that? Or are you looking to actually do testing on, um, features that you've already kind of developed?
S1
Speaker 1
11:35
11:35
I think it's, it's, it's both. I think, uh, I mean, again, I don't have a use case that I want to test right now. Yeah. But of things we do is either testing a certain concepts Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, for example, before Google I was working for Unilever, uh, and Unilever, I think like before you start r and d on any kind of product, you built this a four sized, you know, like a slight looking concepts, which basically with different visual cues, et cetera, that basically describes the customer pain points, the new product and, and the benefits. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], and we were testing that concept before we go anywhere. So I think a lot of, I, I mean, it's, there is not an equivalent of this in, in the tech world of it. Right. Because it's either like, we do more like quality research and get the insights from quality research to prototype, uh, demo some kind of a product.
S1
Speaker 1
12:28
12:28
Yeah. Um, so I think a lot of the, if I were to explore, I would like to explore testing certain concepts Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] about what might be future products and services. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]. And, you know, there is also active products I work on. It might be testing a certain feature within that product, right? Yeah. Or it might be testing with SMBs and what might be additional features we can build. Yeah. Um, so yeah, both of those. Um, one, one question. Um, how, like, how, how does it work? Is it like a self-serving tool product you have or you build, you work with? I would love to hear more about like your, your product and what you offer as well.
S2
Speaker 2
13:11
13:11
Yeah, absolutely. So it's a relatively straightforward interview recording tool. Yes. Um, so it's very much qualitative research based. Um, you can either use, um, the video conferencing facilities directly within the platform, or, um, you can also, we have an integration so that you can invite our meeting bot into a Google meet, uh, and record that way. So for example, my note taker here is, is ada, you can see that's joined there. Yeah. Um, and so that, uh, is, uh, is essentially doing a recording and then transcribing, um, all of the, um, uh, yeah, all of the meeting. Um, and then following that, we built, um, PII redaction tools. So the ability to blur certain areas of the video, uh, the ability to mute and unmute the audio if names are mentioned or if sensitive information is, is mentioned. And so again, just keeping an eye on, on the security and the compliance piece.
S2
Speaker 2
14:00
14:00
Um, we're building in features to, um, uh, to help, uh, customers manage that before they share the videos internally even. Um, and then, uh, I'll show you, I'll show you the product shortly. Um, and then once you've finished your recording, whether you've done it, uh, using a meeting bot or whether you've done it using our video conferencing tool, um, the, uh, uh, the system does the transcription, and then you can essentially use a, a Gemini style or g Gemini integrated chat bott interface to ask questions about the transcripts. So it's very easy to look at, you know, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 interviews, um, and then understand, uh, very quickly what the consistent, um, requests are from, from your customers. Um, so if, yeah, if you're trying to understand about a certain demographic of, of small business, um, then you can recruit people into the, the study. You can ask them the questions, uh, and then you can, um, uh, very quickly, uh, surface all of the insights out of that. Does
S1
Speaker 1
14:53
14:53
That make sense? Yeah. One question, uh, does your product can also, can it also use, let's say, prerecorded materials, let's say a research that was done before not using your platform Yeah. And the technology be used in a way that the feature Yeah.
S2
Speaker 2
15:10
15:10
Yeah. So you can upload videos. So essentially we think of it as a creating a repository of research. So you would create your project or your study, um, you would upload any preexisting materials you have into that. You also might do maybe some stakeholder engagement meetings, uh, beforehand as well. So say for example, you've got internal stakeholders, you wanna understand their objectives, um, you can actually be recording that, those meetings and, and feeding that into the project as well. Um, and then you can put together your, um, your questions, your research questions or your research script, uh, taken into account that context. So you can provide a lot more con you can capture and provide a lot of context that way, um, to, um, uh, to inform your actual research study. And then once you're doing the research study, again, you can either be using Google Meet or you can be using our system. The advantage of our system is, uh, you can, um, you've got complete control over the interface and what's being recorded, so it doesn't switch automatically for you. Um, so if you're interested in watching like a screen share or maybe like an app screen share, or you want to see understand context, or you wanna see sentiment analysis, you wanna, you know, see somebody's face, um, you can choose, um, you, we call it choose your own adventure. You can choose your own adventure through that recording, uh, of the research study.
S1
Speaker 1
16:24
16:24
Got it. And, and that's very interesting. I will love to. And, um, do you also, I think support, because one of the, I think like also challenge with the traditional I research process is finding the right audience, right? I mean, basically identity, like hiring the right audience or recruiting the right audience. Uh, what do you think about that? Or maybe that's out of scope.
S2
Speaker 2
16:50
16:50
Yeah, so at the moment, that's out of scope, but that's on our roadmap for Q3. We're building, um, integrations with some of the big panel providers. So one of the providers in the UK is called Prolific. Uh, one of the other panel providers is called synt. Um, and I think, and those are the two, uh, we're gonna start with prolific, but then we're doing synt as well, so that you can recruit directly into the, uh, into the products. And you can also synchronize with your calendar and all that sort of practical side of things for managing, um, a set of interviews.
S1
Speaker 1
17:16
17:16
Yeah. You know, I think like my, my challenge with I'm, I'm not a, you know, like a research expert obviously, but insights I think is like, is so like, I think core at, at, at our job, right? Yeah. I think all professionals, we spend day in the office, but we don't spend enough time with the people who we develop products and experiences for, funnily enough. Yeah.
S2
Speaker 2
17:41
17:41
Yeah. You know what, Google also has its own internal panel recruitment tool as well. Um, we looked at it brief, I can't remember what it's called. We looked at it briefly last year. 'cause we looked at building an integr, uh, like a direct integration similar to, to recall. Um, uh, so let, yeah, let me find, let me look back and find out what that was. Uh, and I'll share that with you as well, because it does give you access to, um, uh, I guess to an internal pool. And it's not that it's internal people at Google, it's just, um, it's the internal tool for sourcing people.
S1
Speaker 1
18:13
18:13
Yeah. Um, that's, that will be great. Um, one last question. Sorry, I'm asking maybe too much questions.
S2
Speaker 2
18:20
18:20
No, no, of course. This is very good. Um,
S1
Speaker 1
18:22
18:22
Do you also envision our world where the interview is being conducted by ai?
S2
Speaker 2
18:30
18:30
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Um, so that's, uh, that's exactly where we're headed with, with the product. Um, the idea of being, if you've come across, um, systems like centia, um, centia do a kind of pseudo avatar. Its not that amazing, but it's quite popular for people for, for training and for onboarding videos. Uh, and we, yeah, we certainly see a world where actually the, um, either the researcher can prerecord themselves asking the questions, um, and then the, uh, user can be, uh, providing their answers. But, um, in real time, the LLM can be analyzing those answers to see if they're, um, if there's enough information in the answers. And if it's, if there's not, then it can prompt them to ask more information. So say for example, um, uh, you'd asked a specific question about, um, you know, maybe un unmet market needs in your, in their products, um, uh, if somebody just gave a yes or no as their answer, then the, um, the LLM can obviously detect that in real time and prompt them with questions to ask, um, further and to get a much higher quality response.
S1
Speaker 1
19:33
19:33
Yeah. No, I'm checking their, as I'm listening to you, I'm checking Synthesia. Yeah. They have like lots 160 AI hours.
S2
Speaker 2
19:43
19:43
Yes. Yeah. So they, yeah, they're, they're more focused on the training and on onboarding sort of space. And I don't really like them yet [laugh], but you can kind of see where the product's heading. Um, and so yeah, I certainly see a world where, um, you can increase the amount of research that one person can do, um, either by using a, a, an AI avatar like that, or even just by having the researcher ask the, in the initial questions, uh, via a recording, um, and then using the LLM to actually prompt, um, for the, the real time kind of responses. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
20:19
20:19
And all it can be user's choice, right? Like you can have, Hey, I want to receive, I want to either read, I want to listen, or I want to watch as well. Yes. And they can toggle on and off depending on their, you know, preference. Um,
S2
Speaker 2
20:31
20:31
Yeah, absolutely. I think that personalization of the experience is, is so important. Um, but yeah, we're not quite there yet with our product yet, but, um,
S1
Speaker 1
20:39
20:39
But yeah. Yeah. No, no, I'm, I'm just, again, like there is, since there is no specific thing, I'm, you know, I want to, want to get out of this meeting. I'm just exploring and trying to terms of your vision. Perfect. Um,
S2
Speaker 2
20:58
20:58
And what, like, what would you say are kind of the, the core challenges that you're trying to solve? Like you've said that, um, you know, you want to understand where to take, um, how to kind of, I implement AI within the Google Ads product, um, and you want to kind of be able to gather feedback from sort of SMBs, it sounds like you want, do you wanna better share Figma prototypes as well, um, and get that kind of instant feedback on Figma prototypes? Or is it not really that, it's more about talking to real, real customers and understanding how they use Google Ads currently, and then how you might, um, uh, add AI into that exp to improve that experience?
S1
Speaker 1
21:32
21:32
I think, I mean, I think one of the pain points might be, let's say I develop a, I develop a mock or, uh, a certain feature, right? Are testing internally. I want to be able to be at a stage that the next day, like let's say I open a module, right? I'm just thinking out loud at the stage. Yeah. I'm entering my audience Mm-Hmm. I'm answering the questions I want to ask and I'm answering what I want to show. Yeah. And I, I say, okay, done. And then, you know, in 24 hours, 48 hours, whatever. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] I get, even if, I mean, it might not be a lot of people Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], but I get at least some feedback on the initial mock feature, whatever, yeah. From my, from a relevant target audience Mm-Hmm. [affirmative] in a digestible format, right. Not just, you know, like a long takes that I need to digest. Yeah, yeah. Real digestible format. Yeah. Uh, like within, within a very short timeframe. But right now I think it's, it's, it's such a, I will say either lengthy or a bit fuzzy and a foggy process for me. Yeah. Right. We have many tools. I think that's the, that's the issue. Mm-Hmm. That's very clear how I can, uh, build that speed into my learning curve, right? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, that I will say is one of the pain points I observed.
S2
Speaker 2
22:54
22:54
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's actually having access to that digestible information, um, which is really, really valuable because all, I guess all the tools out there give you some of those other elements in various ways. But like you said, how, how do you quickly digest the summary, but then how do you dig into, dig into it further? Almost like, um, if you think about a webpage, you might have a homepage with the, the top level things, then you can choose what you want to, uh, dive into in more detail by following links.
S1
Speaker 1
23:22
23:22
Yeah. Yeah. And like also I think by doing so, I think, I mean also like, not try to, you know, not, not spend too much time trying to recruit people, not try, spend too much time trying to get the agency on board and, you know, like, uh, like align with them on what they need to say, how they will manage the interview. Yeah. Doing it in a very scrap way, like being able to almost as if, imagine I'm in the office, I'm not going downstairs, going to the street asking a couple of people about, hey, how I want it as easy and as cost efficient as in that way.
S2
Speaker 2
23:57
23:57
Yeah. Yeah. Cool. That totally makes sense. Um, yeah, I think, I think you're right. I think the, the recruitment part of, of the process is always quite challenging. People have very different, uh, needs in terms of, in terms of demographics. Um, but, but yeah, prolific, um, does have, I think they have over 200,000, um, uh, participants and you can dig into quite a lot of detail in terms of the, their demographics. Yeah. Um, so yeah, we've sort of identified them as, as the first one that we're gonna integrate with, um, to, to make that process as, as quick and easy as possible. Um, obviously if you are, um, if you're very open-ended in terms of your demographic, then it's, it's quite easy to recruit people in. If you're very, very specific about your demographic, then it can be, it can just take longer to get, to get them into a study and get them through the study and start getting the results back. Um, so it does vary depending on the, the nature of, of your kind of target audience there.
S1
Speaker 1
24:58
24:58
Yeah, no, for sure. Um, like seeing, we have five minutes left. Is there a demo you would like to show?
S2
Speaker 2
25:05
25:05
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Let me just, uh, share my screen and we'll jump into it. I'll just show, um,
S3
Speaker 3
25:11
25:11
Uh,
S2
Speaker 2
25:12
25:12
I have like a presentation as well in terms of what we did for Google last year. Let me just show you the product quickly and then otherwise we'll run outta time. Um, so the version of the tool that we built, uh, for the UXI team is called Cloud Lab. Um, so let me know once you can see my screen.
S1
Speaker 1
25:33
25:33
Yes, I can
S2
Speaker 2
25:34
25:34
You go. Got it now. Cool. Perfect. Um, so it's, it's, you know, runs in Chromes, it's browse based. Um, it's very simple. You just create a new session and jump into a session. Um, I'll just take us into one that's, uh, just playing a prerecorded piece of research so you can get a bit of a sense of it.
S3
Speaker 3
25:50
25:50
I would just go to my Motorola and, um,
S2
Speaker 2
25:56
25:56
Just checking. You can hear that audio from that as well. Right?
S3
Speaker 3
25:58
25:58
I'll, okay, cool. Look at my home
S2
Speaker 2
26:01
26:01
Screen app study. So along the top
S3
Speaker 3
26:04
26:04
Right now, motor release asking me if I want to sign,
S2
Speaker 2
26:08
26:08
Let me just mute her, although we're both talking at the same time, [laugh]. Um, but, uh, essentially you can, uh, you send an invite, uh, to your list of people. You can add them in as participants or as observers. Um, you can also stream to different destinations as well. Um, they, once they join, they appear along the top here. So you can see I'm actually in there as well, uh, in real time. And everything's drag and drop. So whatever's on the canvas here in the middle sounded in the green there is what's being recorded. Um, and then you set up your layouts depending on the nature of the, um, the research you're doing, and then you can move back and forth. So this is where you have, um, you know, it's kind of Google meet on steroids. You've got control over what's being recorded. So if you're most interested in, um, when, how they're using the app and integrating with that, then you can have that on screen, um, throughout.
S2
Speaker 2
26:52
26:52
Um, and very simply, you hit a record button, um, all your records appear over in the, um, in the media pool. Uh, and once the recording's finished, um, you can move into the insights engine, um, and it does the transcription, uh, of the entire process. Um, and then there is, uh, an integration here with Gemini where you can start to ask questions about the transcript. Um, you can also upload your own, um, files in there. So if you've, like you said, if you've got other pieces of research that you want to provide as context, um, then you can get a bit of a sense of those. Um, and, and yeah, you can ask questions and start building out your notes to, uh, to export into your, um, into Google Docs or to start making your Google Slides, however, you're going to share your report back with the product team. Um, so in a nutshell, very quickly, that is, that is what it is. Does that make sense?
S1
Speaker 1
27:44
27:44
That, that's great. Um, when you say that for building a repository Oracle of insights, does it work in the same way so that then, or build a more like a custom solution, uh, when you work, for example, not to do a specific research, but let's say to be, to build the research, uh, knowledge corpus. Yeah. Right. That we can use your product to basically upload all the research and like the other research assistant basically.
S2
Speaker 2
28:16
28:16
Yeah. So, uh, we're not, we're not there yet, but let me show you, um, what's on the roadmap. Uh, and you can start to get us, and yeah, it'd be great to get your feedback on whether this feels like the right sort of thing. We're very focused on the, on the video side of things, um, uh, as you'll see. Um, so yeah, so in terms of the, how you build up the actual repository, so you know, whether you're uploading your videos, recording meetings or, or using the, the study tool itself. Um, actually I didn't show you the privacy protection stuff, but obviously you can see that in there now in terms of that, um, PAI redaction, um, uh, just one of the features we're working on at the moment is, um, AI topic tagging, so that it is very, very easy to tag the elements of transcript, um, so that you can, um, find them and recall them later.
S2
Speaker 2
29:04
29:04
Um, and the idea being that you can actually then create a repository of actual, of actual video content, um, that's all kind of clipped and turned into highlights already, um, so that it can be organized and then filtered and searched very quickly and very easily. Um, so we've kind of created a fairly simple, um, uh, kind of highlights interface so that per project you can, um, very quickly find specific pain points or specific insights, and also then recall all the different people, um, who may have said, uh, or discussed the same thing. And again, this is partly to help build trust with stakeholders. So you might give this access to managers or other product managers to actually dig into it. So if they want to kind of hear, uh, sort of a little bit more about what the customers are saying, um, it's kind of built, built in there. Does that make sense? Right. Is that what you were imagining or what were you imagining in terms of having a repository?
S1
Speaker 1
29:57
29:57
No, no, I think it's, it's similar. I think it's, it's, it's very similar to have something like a poster that can, I think, track many instead of just summarizing a research that can just look at all the past research and can come up with, you know, topics around the same teams or, you know, same pain points. Mm-Hmm. So I know that's, that's exciting. Yeah. They, I it was very nice to meet you. Yeah. And you really appreciate your time. Let's let stay in touch and yeah, if you can share, um, your Google contacts, which on the research side happens to be broader than mine. Yeah, I would appreciate that. And if I see any that I'm not in a research team, but if I see any research team that's exploring similar solutions, I'll definitely keep things in mind and, you know, send them your way as well.
S2
Speaker 2
30:45
30:45
Brilliant. Thank you so much. It was really good to meet you.

	•	Their primary need in external partnerships is access to specific target audiences, not analysis tools or methodologies.
	•	They have a limited budget for external research tools and services.
	•	They are interested in tools that could help quantify qualitative data, but not currently a priority.
	•	They see potential value in using our tool to improve the efficiency of focus groups and community workshops conducted by their planning consultancy business.
	•	They are open to exploring a pay-per-view model for occasional use of the tool.
Key Topics:
	•	Savills' in-house research capabilities and use of big data/machine learning.
	•	Their experiences with Microsoft Copilot and limitations in quantitative analysis.
	•	Use of external market research providers for mystery shopping, customer surveys, and tenant feedback.
	•	Preference for quantitative over qualitative data in their decision-making processes.
	•	Budget constraints and limited spending on external research tools.
	•	Openness to exploring new tools but with a focus on cost-effectiveness and tangible benefits.
	•	Potential use case for our tool in analyzing and quantifying qualitative data from focus groups and community workshops.
	•	Discussion of a pay-per-view model for occasional use of the tool.
Key Actions:
	•	For Beings: Send follow-up materials summarizing our tool's capabilities and potential applications in the planning context.
	•	For Savills: Connect us with the relevant person in their planning consultancy business to explore the use case further.
	•	For Beings: Schedule a demo of the tool with the planning consultancy team to showcase its capabilities in analyzing conversational data from focus groups and community workshops.
Talk time:
	•	Mat (Speaker 0): 67.7%
	•	Dave (Speaker 1): 32.3%
Sentiment Analysis:
	•	Mat (Speaker 0): Overall neutral to slightly positive. While expressing reservations about the immediate need for the tool due to budget constraints and existing processes, Mat shows curiosity and openness to exploring potential applications, particularly for focus groups and community workshops. He is willing to make introductions and facilitate further conversations, indicating a positive outlook towards future collaboration.
	•	Dave (Speaker 1): Overall positive and solution-oriented. Dave actively listens to Mat's concerns and tailors his responses accordingly. He demonstrates flexibility by proposing a pay-per-view model and expressing willingness to provide a done-for-you service. Dave maintains a positive tone throughout, highlighting the potential value of the tool and seeking opportunities for collaboration, even suggesting a follow-up demo to address specific needs.
Quantitative data points:
	•	Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research Ratio: Mat states that qualitative research comprises less than 1% of their research needs. This provides a clear picture of the relative importance of each type of research at Savills.
	•	External Research Spending: Mat reveals that their external research spending is "tiny" and they prefer to do things in-house whenever possible. He mentions only one major external research project per year and a few smaller surveys. This indicates a low budget allocation for external research tools and services.
	•	Copilot Usage: Mat mentions that Copilot is currently being used in all their Teams meetings. This suggests a high adoption rate of the tool within the company for note-taking and meeting summaries.
	•	Language Support: Dave mentions that their tool supports 27 languages, indicating a broad potential customer base and a focus on diverse linguistic needs.
	•	Number of Market Research Agencies: Mat estimates that there are half a dozen major players in the focus group market. This information could be useful for Dave in identifying potential partners or clients.
Potential Applications of Our Tool for Savills:
	•	Focus Groups and Community Workshops:
	•	Challenge: Manually transcribing and analysing qualitative feedback from focus groups and community workshops is time-consuming and can lead to mistakes.
	•	Solution: Our tool automatically transcribes audio recordings, pinpoints key themes and sentiments, and measures agreement/disagreement among participants. This streamlines analysis, providing faster, more accurate insights for planning decisions.
	•	Tenant Feedback and Satisfaction Surveys:
	•	Challenge: Gathering and analysing feedback from tenants across a large portfolio is difficult and often relies on manual methods.
	•	Solution: Our tool can analyse open-ended survey feedback and extract key takeaways, helping Savills understand tenant satisfaction, pinpoint areas for improvement, and proactively address concerns. This can boost tenant retention and overall property performance.
	•	Employee Performance and Training:
	•	Challenge: Mystery shopping offers valuable feedback, but it's limited in scope and frequency due to resource limitations.
	•	Solution: Our tool can analyse recorded interactions between employees and clients (with permission), providing a more complete and unbiased view of performance. This data can be used for training, improving performance, and identifying best practices.
	•	Competitive Intelligence and Market Research:
	•	Challenge: Gathering and analysing information on competitors and market trends is often a manual and time-consuming process.
	•	Solution: Our tool can analyse publicly available data, such as news articles, social media posts, and industry reports, to identify emerging trends, competitor strategies, and potential risks or opportunities. This can help Savills stay ahead of the game and make more informed business decisions.
	•	Internal Communication and Knowledge Sharing:
	•	Challenge: Internal meetings and discussions often lack a structured way to capture and share insights.
	•	Solution: By recording and analysing internal meetings, our tool can highlight key takeaways, action points, and areas of agreement or disagreement. This creates a searchable knowledge base, facilitates better decision-making, and fosters transparency within the organisation.

Fabulous. Um, how's it going? I don't see you. Oh, no, I do see you now. Now. Okay. There you are. Fabulous. Uh, so yeah, um, great to meet you. Thank you so much. Um, uh, no worries too, Steve, pass me your details. I appreciate you, uh, taking some time. Um, I'd love to hear a little bit about you, um, and, uh, yeah, discover if there's anything we can do to support what you're trying to achieve.
S0
Speaker 0
00:25
00:25
Um, I dunno how much he fed back from our conversation.
S1
Speaker 1
00:29
00:29
Yeah, yeah. No, he was telling me a little bit about, about you and sort of, um, but yeah, I'd love to hear it again from, you
S0
Speaker 0
00:34
00:34
Know, most of what we, well, I suppose, you know what, what, you know, I, I run our commercial property research for Europe and the Middle East. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um, 99% of what we do is, is sort of quant Yeah. Research based on sort of proprietary data sets that we assemble ourselves. Um, or we buy in cleanup from external sources. Um, you know, we, we, I guess we've sort of, we embraced sort of big data, data and machine learning with, with many of those things as much as we could quite early on. Um, and I suppose going through the second, the second phase of that, which is probably more around wider working practices within the business. So, you know, we, like every other mid-size business is being sort of heavily courted by Microsoft to, uh, take copilot globally. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and so we've got, you know, a reasonable number of trials that we've been running across the business, including in my teams. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I expect,
S1
Speaker 1
01:49
01:49
Just so I can understand it more broadly, a little bit like, are you selling your market research services to other parties? Or is it purely internal to inform the work?
S0
Speaker 0
01:59
01:59
Um, both. Both. Yeah. Um, we, we, we sell raw data. Um, we sell our analysis of that raw data and we undertake work on, you know, specific, answering specific questions for our clients. That's probably about half of what we do for a living. Yeah. Um, the other half is, is, you know, marketing, you know, research as marketing. Um, yeah. So it is producing content, be it for sort of, you know, traditional publications or socials to try and make people think that we know more about X than any of our competitors really. And we, we don't spend an awful lot of money on corporate marketing as a business. Yeah. Um,
S1
Speaker 1
02:50
02:50
But then I guess the nature of work that you're doing is much more niche. It doesn't apply as broadly really as, um, uh, as, you know, 'cause it's that commercial real estate focus presumably.
S0
Speaker 0
03:01
03:01
Yeah, yeah. You know, but we do a very, you know, we, everything I've said sort of to date would apply equally to our residential business apart from some of the sort of, um, you know, if we get into how we use external market research, um, you know, we do, you know, we, we've long used sort of external consultants to do mystery shopper Yeah. On our residential branch networks, be it face-to-face or be it, um, about, you know, electronic approaches to our business. We survey our customers regularly in that, more regularly in the residential business than we do in, in the commercial business. Um, and how
S1
Speaker 1
03:45
03:45
Do you feel about that? Like, um, it's quite interesting to hear, I guess, so in when you're, so when you are doing mystery shopper stuff, that's actually kind of employee metrics and employee engagement that, that side of things to see how the,
S0
Speaker 0
03:56
03:56
It is, what is the experience Yeah. For you, the potential person looking to rent a flat or rent your flat out or buy a property. If you walk into the S'S office in Windsor or you contact Yeah. Asked via our chat app or you make a phone call, it's just been a, how, how good is that? So literally it's, it's right back to sort of 1950s style market research where someone walks into a branch and pretends to be a potential customer. Yeah. Uh, and they then report back to us on various aspects of the service that we are interested in.
S1
Speaker 1
04:36
04:36
And how often are you doing that and like how effective is it? Um,
S0
Speaker 0
04:43
04:43
It, it's just that I'm not that close to the residential business. I think it is done at least annually of every method of contacting our business. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and then the other sort of, you know, the sort of the other, you know, I suppose there's a number of other areas in which we use external market research providers. Um, we are, we manage a lot of property for people. Yeah. Um, so, you know, we're the biggest manager of shopping centers in, for example, in Europe. And, you know, essentially the owner pays us to deal with all the day-to-day aspects of operating that, dealing with their tenants, dealing with security, um, you know, managing the social media for that thing. But, you know, a lot of that will involve also, you know, regular surveys of their customers. Their tenants find out what they're happy with, not they're happy with. Yeah. Sometimes it's, we, it is, we use a template that we apply across our, you know, our entire portfolio. Sometimes we use our clients template that they apply across their portfolio. Yeah. Predominantly qualitative. Hmm. Um, and
S1
Speaker 1
06:02
06:02
How do you go about that at the moment? What sort of tools and platforms are you using?
S0
Speaker 0
06:05
06:05
It is, it is, it's generally, it's all subcontracted to market research companies. Gotcha. Okay. Um, you know, we don't, it's not, we don't have the resource or the headcounts do it ourselves. And then the other area that we use, we, you know, the other sort of tool as it were, and the wider sense of tools that we use would be, you know, someone either for very large scale, should we call it almost B2C type stuff, you know, the al type route. Yeah. Um, and for the smaller scale B2B, um, the sort of SurveyMonkey type route.
S1
Speaker 1
06:36
06:36
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
06:37
06:37
Fine. Um, both of, you know, they tend to be in both cases more trying to gather quantitative data than qualitative data. Yeah. Yeah. Um, we're not, you know, I'm certainly not, if I'm talking about what I do, I'm not, I don't have a particular interest or need for qualitative comment. Yeah. You know, my world is very black and white, very spreadsheet driven. Yeah. The customers I deal with, you know, they, they don't want opinion. They want fact. Yeah. Um, they want measurable data. Um, yeah. Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
07:12
07:12
Is that always possible to get for them? Like do you feel
S0
Speaker 0
07:15
07:15
Like Yeah. Quality. Yeah. It's, yeah, because, you know, the sheer nature of, of modern buildings is there are building management systems that generate huge amounts of data ranging from Yeah. How many people swipe through the entry gates of a building in the morning through to, you know, the temperatures across the building and occupancy, et cetera. So Yeah. Um, you know, the one, you know, the sort of, the thing we are most, and we've pretty much written off co-pilots as a quantitative tool. Okay. It just doesn't seem to work very well in terms of, of doing what Microsoft say it might do. What is it that you wanted with Excel spreadsheets? You know, essentially to, to automate analysis. Yeah, yeah. Um, um, and actually make some informed conclusions from that. Mm-Hmm. Where it is, where we think it is gonna work for us is, is possibly crosses over into what you are offering. Having had a cursory look at your website, which is the sort of take something that doesn't look like quantitative data. Yeah. Take something qualitative and see if you can make something quantitative out of it. And, you know, we are, that's
S1
Speaker 1
08:31
08:31
What we're trying to build. We're trying
S0
Speaker 0
08:32
08:32
Increasingly, you know, we can definitely see that, you know, the tools that we're testing out in terms of the overlays on sort of, you know, the teams meetings that Yeah. You know, will give you a, a summary of what was said, what the, what the tone of the meeting was, how many people in the meeting agreed with statements disagreed with statements. Um, you know, that, that is interesting. And I guess probably the question, you know, you know, a key question for me in terms of what your product offers is, well, what more does it does do than that? Um, and I suppose the, the final, the other point, you know, I had a quick look at, you know, your, you know, the, the percentage of our, our sort of global, let's call it research spend Mm-Hmm. That goes to out of house suppliers, providers, tools or whatever is, is tiny. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and it will always be tiny. We will always prefer to do stuff in house that essentially costs us nothing. It's just the way we're structured. Um, you mean
S1
Speaker 1
09:45
09:45
In terms of market research
S0
Speaker 0
09:47
09:47
External? Yeah. You know, we, you know, we, we, we, we probably do, you know, in my patch, you know, we might do, you know, one you big [inaudible] piece a year and a, you know, half a dozen things on SurveyMonkey and that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, we are not, you know, despite being a sort of medium sized company, we're not a medium-sized spender on this stuff. We'd be more likely to engage with you on a sort of pay-per-view basis than on a sort of global enterprise type basis.
S1
Speaker 1
10:22
10:22
Yeah. So actually that's what we did with Google. So the way that we set it up with them, uh, was a consumption model. So it's kind of, there's a, a very minimal cost for the actual license for per user. Um, and then essentially, um, there are, you get credits on the system, so the more you use it, you can, um, buy more credits and bundle them up and get greater discounts on those credits. We've tried to make it as flexible as possible. 'cause what, what we've found getting into this space is, is that huge variation in the quantity of, of what, what, or just how much research people do or don't do of this type
S0
Speaker 0
10:57
10:57
Mm-Hmm.
S1
Speaker 1
10:58
10:58
I was really interested to
S0
Speaker 0
10:59
10:59
Hear about, yeah. For an FM CG company, I'm sure it's a huge
S1
Speaker 1
11:02
11:02
Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
11:03
11:03
Huge spend, but it's just, you know, it's not informa, you know, information that we really need that often. Yeah. And I don't envisage it that really changing just 'cause particularly for me, because we know who we want, who, you know, we know what we need, we know what we want, we know where to get it. Yeah. And occasionally we'll go into a new market or a new sector or have to go full B2C type research. Um, and that's when we tend to bring in external providers and, you know, that was going back to the days that we used to instruct, you know, phone banks in call centers to call people and ask questions through to, you know, obviously we've moved on a bit from that, but anyway, that's where we are.
S1
Speaker 1
11:46
11:46
Yeah. Fascinating. So, um, do you think that, um, if you were to put a percentage on what proportion of qualitative versus quantitative that you do, I guess there's a couple of things I just want to understand. You, obviously, you've said that you really are focused on the quantitative, but you have this sense, or you were hoping that with copilot it may have been able to quantify the qualitative nature of a conversation. Um,
S0
Speaker 0
12:09
12:09
Yeah, that,
S1
Speaker 1
12:11
12:11
Is that fair to say? Am I, am I playing that back
S0
Speaker 0
12:13
12:13
To [crosstalk]? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But again, the sort of, it's not that important because the quality of tight research is, is, is probably less than 1% of what we need. Um, so not, not having a particularly efficient way of doing it is not a problem. Yeah. Um, you know, if we were to agree to with Microsoft to go sort of in a full co-pilot rollout across our business, then obviously we use it because it would be a central it costs, but Yeah. Yeah. It, it isn't a gaping hole in my life not having this because frankly, there are a lot of people out there who will take notes and write them up for us if we pay them. Yeah. Yeah. But it's one of those things, you know, the reason why I thought it was worth the call is like, you know, you never know. I, you know, I never know when, you know, someone could ring up tomorrow and one of our clients and go, is there any chance you could do? Yeah. Um, you know, we do a lot of work, but, you know, we, the people who own one the Westfield shopping centers in the uk and they might just come to us and go, look, we haven't got time to do it. Could you do a survey on X? Yeah,
S1
Speaker 1
13:31
13:31
Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
13:33
13:33
Everyone who's ever engaged with the Westfield brand and
S1
Speaker 1
13:36
13:36
Yeah. And so they would come to you as the, as the building manager.
S0
Speaker 0
13:40
13:40
They might, um, yeah, sometimes they might, some, you know, they might go to, they may go director, a marketing agency, they might go to market research company, they might go to their PR firm. You just never know. So it's, you know, it's useful for me to know what tools I can call upon Yeah, yeah. In these kind of situations rather than, I don't wanna lead you down the garden path and say, look, we have an immediate quantifiable need in terms of, of saving man hours or spending money.
S1
Speaker 1
14:09
14:09
Yeah. I guess in terms of what, when you do go to spend with the market research agencies, um, you sort of, perhaps you were suggesting that maybe you actually, you might be better to do some of that in-house if it was kind of more cost effective. Like what sort of spend would you be replacing or would you, what would it need to do to [crosstalk]? It
S0
Speaker 0
14:25
14:25
Depends what we're doing. Like I would say generally we don't go to the market research agencies for, um, their tools or their methodology. We go to them for their user base. Yeah. So the reason why we always go and find ourselves going back to [inaudible] or one of their peers is, you know, literally, you know, we can say to them, we want to engage with decision makers in mid-size companies in the telecom sector across Europe. Yeah. Um, and we know that list isn't perfect, but it's better than our list. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, the, the analysis, you know, we str you know, we write the survey, we do the, we don't, we never pay them to analyze the data 'cause we've got lots of analysts who can do it. So. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we're not, it, we don't have a burning need for a tool, I think is is the case and where we're doing a sort of, you know, where we're doing a sort of a smaller thing again. We'll, we can do it very cheaply ourselves in house when we'll send it to, you know, a list of people that we know. So, you know, what we're buying in usually is is the, is the mailing list the tool? The
S1
Speaker 1
15:38
15:38
Recruitment, yeah. Yeah, the recruitment. Yeah. No, that totally makes sense. Um, and I think it's, that is often the case for a lot of people. Um, yeah, I think where we're building is really in that kind of, uh, is in that structuring of, of the unstructured data that you would have in a conversation. So it, it's more in that mystery shopper world where in your context, perhaps it would make more sense. 'cause essentially those interactions would get recorded. Um, and then, uh, similar to, to copilot, but a lot better, um, they, um, uh, you can then extract all of the insights very, very easily and quickly. All that's transcribed dramatically. It all kind of brings out all of that. So I think there's nothing particularly surprising in, in that, uh, that element of it. What we're, um, trying to build is, is that ability for it to learn some of the expertise that the, the analyst is bringing to it. So as every time they do a piece of analysis using the tool, um, it then teaches their, their particular AI personalizes that AI towards what they're interested in discovering. So the next time they come back to the tool again, um, it actually has some of the context of what they were looking at before.
S1
Speaker 1
16:44
16:44
Um, so it's that ability to, um, to personalize the AI for their use to, to speed up that analysis piece. Um, and really in terms of the analysis, what it, what it's doing is, is, uh, is asking the, the user, the, the researcher in your case to, um, just to tag, just to codify the different elements within the, within the transcript. And that's how it learns and what it is that you're looking for. I think with tools like copilot, you know, they'll get better and better and better, but there'll always be a generic level of, of offering, um, because they just can't, um, you know, personalize it to every, every different person's use case. Um, so that, yeah, that's where we're trying to get to with it. Um, uh, okay. Cool. Um, I mean, it sounds like there's not huge amounts f from your perspective to explore, but, uh, for me, like we're very early stage. We are a, a year and a half old. Uh, we've just raised a million pounds to, so, you know, build the future of research. And so really for me, it's so useful to get into this sort of conversation just to understand in these different areas, uh, how much qualitative research or quantitative people do, and also get a feeling for, um, uh, for the conversational side of things. Right? Mm-Hmm. [affirmative]
S1
Speaker 1
17:57
17:57
If actually, no,
S0
Speaker 0
17:58
17:58
I think the sort of the, you know, the, the thing that leaps out at me from what you said is you are, it feels like you are, what you are offering is something that essentially is saying, let's assume that you currently have people employed within your organization who do market research, know who are interviewing people or picking up the phone to people or whatever. You know, what you are offering is a tool essentially to make, enable them to work in a smarter fashion, therefore to be more profitable per working person hour.
S1
Speaker 1
18:37
18:37
Yeah. It's, it's getting the insights out quicker. So it's just about accelerating that process because rather than somebody having to take notes and then go through those notes and write them up and then get the data points into a spreadsheet, we we're starting to automate all of that process. So you might be sat in a meeting with your colleagues, um, that, uh, you know, somewhat a sort of stakeholder meeting that's gonna inform the research that's gonna take place. And instead of having to write that up in an email and send it to a market research agency, it's all captured, it's all transcribed, um, and it understands that context for the research that's then gonna take place. Right. So, um, then your, your market research agency in your mystery shoppers would go out and, and do the research having much richer context for the, the questions that they're asking. Um, so again, in terms of, you know, you can get all of the suggestions for what questions you might ask in that survey, just off the back of that meeting, you might have had between three or four of you.
S0
Speaker 0
19:33
19:33
Um, but know, my gut feel is that, you know, the majority of, you know, sort of companies in, in the sort of service sector, you know, we, we made the decision not to employ these kind of people decades ago because you don't need them all the time. Why would you carry them on your balance sheet? That is why external market research companies exist. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, it's an oncall thing, so it feels to me slightly what you're offering is, is to save us money on something we're not spending money on. Mm-Hmm. So what's, or am I reading it wrong? Are you saying that, you know, if were we to sort of buy X units, whatever, we could pass that on to our preferred market research company? Hmm.
S1
Speaker 1
20:24
20:24
I, so I think in your context, it would make more sense for us to be talking to your market research agency. Okay. Um, like, just very simply in, in, in Google's case, they've got 1500 in-house researchers. Hmm. So it is a very different thing for the, it has much more value to them internally. 'cause like you said, you've not got a head count that is worth saving 80% of their time because Yeah. You actually just buy that service in when you need it. Um, you know, I think there's potentially an element,
S0
Speaker 0
20:50
20:50
There's one, there's one area of our business where I think it would, where, you know, as you were sort of responding.
S1
Speaker 1
20:58
20:58
Yeah. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
20:59
20:59
Um, and in, in the sort of the planning world in the uk it's a particularly a UK thing. Um, you know, for a large project to get planning permission, you generally have to demonstrate to the council that stakeholders are bought into this. And you have to do lots of community workshops. Um, and that will be, you know, with informed groups of individuals right down to the sort of, you know, the mother and toddler group in Lambers, you know Oh, wow. Who might be down the way. And you have these literally workshops that people are invited to, maybe they're bribed to with the offer of a free gift
S1
Speaker 1
21:41
21:41
Incentive. Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
21:42
21:42
Um, or they come along and, you know, there is a sort of semi, it's a semi-structured group interview slash focus group. Mm. Um, and then the, you know, the notes are written up and, and, you know, a, the findings of those various groups are given some degree of, of quantitative analysis and presented as part of the planning application that says, you know, broadly the local community, like the idea of this, or they don't hate the idea of this. Now there is a whole little industry of running these focus groups. What's
S1
Speaker 1
22:23
22:23
That hold? Like, as in, you didn't think of it as research straight away, but it's because it fits into that planning context. Like
S0
Speaker 0
22:29
22:29
Yeah. 'cause it doesn't really fall into my brief, but you will find that, you know, you will find that, you know, it is the norm. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, it is a focus, it's focus grouping really. Um, uh, we, you know, we, you know, our planning division, planning consultancy business, which is the largest planning consultancy business in the uk. I'm pretty certain they outsource all of that. Yeah, yeah. Um, you know, our, our staff will attend, but the actual, and the, and the agencies who do this kind of stuff, they do everything from sort of sourcing the venue, publicizing it, and making sure the right people are there, organizing the catering through to running the session, and are planning consultants will probably be there watching and listening, um, be
S1
Speaker 1
23:23
23:23
Involved along real time remotely. Do you see what I mean? That's what happens with Google. There's this observability thing. So instead of, you essentially join a, a Microsoft teams type of meeting, uh, you know, in a browser, and they would be able to observe and they can message people and
S0
Speaker 0
23:37
23:37
[crosstalk] and how does it work in a live
S1
Speaker 1
23:39
23:39
Yeah. It's all live
S0
Speaker 0
23:40
23:40
Situation.
S1
Speaker 1
23:40
23:40
Absolutely.
S0
Speaker 0
23:41
23:41
As in, I mean, non-screen based, you know, these are rooms full of people sat on chairs
S1
Speaker 1
23:45
23:45
Mobile app. So you just, you can just record.
S0
Speaker 0
23:48
23:48
So someone's gonna take notes. Okay. Um,
S1
Speaker 1
23:53
23:53
Oh no. So the, sorry, the mobile app just does the recording, uh, and that all gets transcribed. The audio
S1
Speaker 1
23:58
23:58
Yeah. And that all gets transcribed. And it can also, like, um, it can tell the difference between different people's voices and so it can start to diarize different voices and then you can that as you talk there, that it's actually really interesting. I, it's somewhere I'd never even thought about, but there's, um, there's real, um, yeah, there's obviously real value in being able to capture and accelerate the speed at which they can write up all of that. Um, but yeah, not, not from your perspective, but from the research agency's perspective, so they can be more efficient in the way that they
S0
Speaker 0
24:27
24:27
Go out there.
S1
Speaker 1
24:28
24:28
Would you be happy to point me in that right direction?
S0
Speaker 0
24:31
24:31
Yeah, no, definitely. 'cause I think that that is an immediate, you know, there, there is a, my gut feel is that's an, there is an immediate Yeah. Because it is, you know, I, you see the transcripts of these things and they're very waffly and very, yeah. Um, chaotic and however good the, the people steering it go
S1
Speaker 1
24:53
24:53
Mm-Hmm. Stuff gets missed. Uh,
S0
Speaker 0
24:56
24:56
And there is, you know, there is a, there are, as far as I'm aware, there are half a dozen sort of major players in that space who do most of these things. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I don't know who they are. Uh, yeah. But yeah, no, I can reach out and, and, and provide an introduction to the pro someone in our planning consultancy business who will know the answer to that. Mm-Hmm. Um, I think, you know, the mystery shopper thing, you know, it's not likely that we would go down this route. I think the issue of it's very, you know, it's very, you know, it's very, um, very sensitive for us. Um, so, you know, we stick with a couple of tried and trusted providers. Mm-Hmm. [affirmative], um,
S1
Speaker 1
25:44
25:44
Again, I think we would be able to offer technology that might support what they're doing, but like you say, it would need them to actually buy into it and see the value in, in accelerating their processes. Um, you know, obviously there's massive security concerns with, with the Google work that we do, and so we're very, um, buttoned up on that side of things.
S0
Speaker 0
26:04
26:04
Yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
26:05
26:05
'cause we are, at the end of the day, handling very, very sensitive, often free release, um, you know, software and products, uh, research information,
S0
Speaker 0
26:12
26:12
Blindingly, ous question as it stands today, the product, does it work in any other language other than English?
S1
Speaker 1
26:18
26:18
Uh, yeah. So we've got support for I think 27 languages now. Okay. Um, all sorts of different dialects. And that's a massive, uh, focus for us as a business. We feel that there's a lot of nuance that gets lost in conversation when someone's forced to talk in, uh, in their non-native language. Mm-Hmm. Um, and so yeah, I think there's a, there is an opportunity there for us to provide that kind of, that last mile, um, of, of, of knowledge really, but connecting businesses to, to the people down at the end of the stream, engaging with their services. Um, so
S0
Speaker 0
26:50
26:50
Yeah. [crosstalk], so if, if we wanted to do a, a one off, you know, like we, we're never gonna be enormously enamored with the idea of paying, paying an annual fee for something that we don't know how much we're gonna use it. Yeah. And, you know, we're always gonna be keen with a Yeah. I want to, you know, pick up the phone and go, Dave, we've got this project Mm-Hmm. You know, how much would you charge Yeah. To facilitate us doing it better. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and I think then there's a question of actually, is it a situation where, because your team know the software Yeah. They would be more involved? Or is it just hand, you know, is your business model just about handing us a tool and we have to work out how to use it ourselves? Um,
S1
Speaker 1
27:38
27:38
No, not at all. I think the more that we talk to our end customers, the more they say like, we want a done for us service, please, Dave. Mm-Hmm. Uh, and with the best intentions, yes, I was hoping to build a software business, but I think the reality is that it's, it's, it's mixed is is the requirement. And as you can imagine with someone like Google was, requires a huge amount of hand haunting [laugh] Yeah. A different way
S0
Speaker 0
28:01
28:01
[crosstalk]. But just think like, you know, having to learn how to use another software tool for a very occasional use is not great. Yeah. It's not worth, and then paying for it, paying for the, is never gonna be a particularly easy selling to our business. Uh, whereas just here is a use, you know, a team that can make a previously quite painful and unscientific piece of work less painful.
S1
Speaker 1
28:25
28:25
Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
28:26
28:26
Yeah. Well, we'd love,
S1
Speaker 1
28:27
28:27
I love that opportunity. If, if, if you're happy, we could schedule a call to sort of just explore a specific scenario when you have a need. Yeah. And say like, and just, just try, try us out and say, Dave, well look how, how will you approach this problem and how will your technology help to, to solve this problem? Um,
S0
Speaker 0
28:45
28:45
Have you got, you know, in terms of, obviously I had to flick through the website, but have you got just something I can send on internally that Yeah,
S1
Speaker 1
28:52
28:52
Of course.
S0
Speaker 0
28:53
28:53
Uh, talk three was I'll need to track down the right person in our planning business really who will be able to get proper look, see and go, actually yeah. This is Yeah. Yeah. Something that we should be using or something we should be suggesting to our preferred Yeah,
S1
Speaker 1
29:08
29:08
Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
29:09
29:09
Focus group consultants that they should be using. Yeah. Yeah. Or we buy it and, or we take out a subscription and we make it available to whoever, whoever we're working with that week. Um,
S1
Speaker 1
29:22
29:22
The advantage of, of your ownership is it becomes your secure repository of research. Mm-Hmm. And so you build up context over time, whereas what all the market research agencies at the moment are doing is using everyone's data to train their ai. Do you see what I mean? They have the best market research ai, so it's Yeah. Yeah. It's a,
S0
Speaker 0
29:40
29:40
It's a d because actually, you know, the planning, you know, it's not our data, you know, if someone is paying us to run this, this inquiry, you know Yeah. Everything we do is their property, the client's property. So that, you know, frankly, it would be a bit, it would almost be a bit wrong of us if we were to
S1
Speaker 1
30:02
30:02
Sort of anyway. Yeah, yeah. Fair enough
S0
Speaker 0
30:04
30:04
To do that. But yeah, if you wanna send, send me over something that sort of, that is sort of, you know, the, the, in a nutshell, um, and I'll, I'll track down the right person on that side that feels like the most immediate.
S1
Speaker 1
30:16
30:16
Yeah. Yeah. That's
S0
Speaker 0
30:17
30:17
Fascinating. That would be of in could be of interest Yeah. To a bit of our business today. Um, my best friend
S1
Speaker 1
30:25
30:25
Actually has just left British land. Oh yeah. And he was, he was a development manager at British Land. He's just gone freelance with a, a, another guy from British Land and they've, they're setting up a, a, a development, a management company. Um, and so he's often talked about the planning process, so I'm gonna go straight back to him to, uh, to get a better understanding of
S0
Speaker 0
30:44
30:44
Yeah, no, definitely that would be a, a useful call. And I think, you know, that the other bit, the bit I haven't quite got in my head around that might work is, is the sort of the property management angle. Yeah. Um, and it could be a service that we offer to our clients like British Land. It's just going like, you know, you haven't got time to do this. Mm-Hmm. We can run it quickly and more efficiently, but actually yeah, they're a really good example. They're, you know, they talk a lot as a business about the customer and, and they say they, you know, they survey their customers regularly and they, and their, they do, you know, they and their peer group, they do it themselves. They do it in house in some way, shape or form. They never ask us to do it despite the fact that we're their property manager. But, um,
S1
Speaker 1
31:31
31:31
You mean like a sort of tenant tenant
S0
Speaker 0
31:34
31:34
[crosstalk]? Yeah. Yeah. They do. You know, because you know, their, their job, their business is about keeping their tenants happy. Mm. Um, and it can be everything from, you know, we have a, we have a property management tool that we've developed, which, you know, I managed on the ground have on a phone and it essentially, it's a non-AI based of what you are offering, which is they're having a chat with the manager of, of, you know, h and m in a shopping center in Glasgow. And she mentions the fact that the light in the loading area has been flickering for a week. And our guy or girl can just quickly enter it on the app and Nice. We see it, our facilities team see it, our contractors see it, the client sees it, everyone sees it simultaneously. Yeah. Yeah. And they see the workflow attached. Um,
S1
Speaker 1
32:22
32:22
Yeah. So in that context, we could offer an API for their mobile app and they could kind of pull it in and they could, uh, just essentially record that conversation. Ah. Um, so if it was like a 10 or a 20 minute conversation, um, you could, yeah. You could essentially get a little bit more out of it than just the sort of the notes that, um, that Brett might take on site. So,
S0
Speaker 0
32:42
32:42
Um, but they will be, that would be a very, you know, if you were looking at, well, I dunno how many other sort of real estate businesses you've spoken to, um, you know, the major, the major owners of Yeah. Commercial and residential real estate are your, will be your obvious clients. Yeah. Yeah. Whether you own, you know, whether you're a local authority or a housing association that has, you know, X thousand houses under its management or you are a British land or a realty, um, who has, you know, tens if not hundreds of millions of square feet of property with tenants in it, you know, they all want to know what their tenants are thinking, what they're feeling, what their stress points are. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we market ourselves heavily as a sort of tech enabled property manager to these people because we've built all of these tools in a house that make it easier. Um, but if I were you and I was looking at sort of building a real, you know, selling into the real estate world, you know, I would be looking at, you know, who are the, you know, 10 largest owners of
S1
Speaker 1
33:55
33:55
Yeah.
S0
Speaker 0
33:56
33:56
Retail property or whatever and, and hitting them up and very convenient that you've got a mate who's ex BO because he will or she will be able to tell you. Yeah, yeah.
S1
Speaker 1
34:06
34:06
Who knew, right. Who knew. That's an interesting I'd never even made.
S0
Speaker 0
34:11
34:11
Yeah. Other than that, I think it, you know, it isn't, there isn't that much in our sector that would be, you know, I certainly, I talk to all my peers in the sort of advisory world and you know, we're all Microsoft customers, we're all gonna be rolling out copilot. I think all of us will go. That would probably do for most of our day to day internal needs. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I do think, you know, something will crop up occasion, you know, will crop up at some point where I just think actually you might be able to do this quicker, cheaper, or better than us, or all of the above.
S1
Speaker 1
34:48
34:48
Yeah. And so in the, in the copilot world, you were just in the same way that I've invited Ada into this meeting as the notetaker, uh, you were just invited into your teams meeting, um, when it was appropriate. So when you need, when you were doing a stakeholder engagement meeting or something before talking to your research agency, you would just bring the notetaker in to establish,
S0
Speaker 0
35:08
35:08
It comes to all of our teams meetings now. So Yeah. If we were on teams, I co-pilot would be taking notes and giving me a summary.
S1
Speaker 1
35:14
35:14
Yeah, that's what I mean. Exactly. Yeah. When you were going to do some research. Yeah. It would kind give you the direct access into the research workflow.
S0
Speaker 0
35:22
35:22
Um, yeah. Okay. Well drop, drop me that. Drop me that material and I'll, I'll sort of, um, you know, as a first action Mm-Hmm. Find the right person for you to talk to in our planning consultancy business. 'cause I do think that is, uh, it may not be us that would be a customer, but then they, there'll be someone who'll go, no, you should talk to these three people that we use. Yeah. For all of our public inquiry focus grouping. Yeah. Brilliant. Oh, well thank you so much. I do appreciate. No, it's a pleasure. Appreciate spending some time. No, absolutely. And I do know, I'd love to actually see a demo in action sometime. Absolutely. Happy to do that.
