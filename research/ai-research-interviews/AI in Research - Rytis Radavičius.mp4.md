  
**Speaker 0 (3:05 \- 3:26:05):** Uh, thank you very much for joining. Thanks a lot for your time. Uh, so we have two other participants here, Dina, who is our, uh, UX and UA designer, and then we have Edda, uh, \<crosstalk\> 

**Speaker 1 (3:29:25 \- 3:38:45):** Designer of what, 

**Speaker 0 (4:01:45 \- 11:05:45):** Uh, UX UA designer for the company called beings.com. I'm a product manager there. I'm, uh, \<inaudible\>, uh, so my job is to, uh, work on, uh, research and insights of our, our tools that we are developing. We are developing AI products for, uh, market research. Okay. And Ida is a automatic note taker. Um, uh, do you mind if we keep it here to record the meeting? 

**Speaker 1 (11:38:25 \- 12:45:25):** Oh, yeah. If you need it for, for, for your research purposes. 

**Speaker 0 (12:53:55 \- 14:01:25):** Yeah. This is only for our internal use, just for by, uh, our product team. 

**Speaker 1 (14:47:35 \- 15:23:45):** Yeah. If it's a standard procedure, that's fine. 

**Speaker 0 (15:37:35 \- 17:05:05):** Okay, great. Thank you very much. Uh, could you please tell me how to pronounce your name? 

**Speaker 1 (17:23:35 \- 17:28:25):** Rita. 

**Speaker 0 (17:40:55 \- 18:44:25):** Rita? Yeah. Thanks a lot, Rita. Uh, so would you like to 

**Speaker 1 (18:47:45 \- 18:51:05):** Re 

**Speaker 0 (19:01:35 \- 21:49:05):** Yeah. Re Yes. Uh, would you like to explain a little bit more about your job? What do you do? What is your day-to-Day responsibility and a little bit more about your research? 

**Speaker 1 (22:09:15 \- 24:36:35):** I, I want to ask about, well, Dave was the one who contacted me, so he's, he's not going to be present, is he? 

**Speaker 0 (24:37:05 \- 26:53:55):** Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I should have clarified before. Yeah. He is the CEO of the company. He got another meeting, so it'll be only me. Mm-Hmm. And, uh, and Dina? 

**Speaker 1 (27:15:05 \- 27:45:05):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. Okay. 

**Speaker 0 (27:54:15 \- 28:14:25):** Yeah. And, and, 

**Speaker 1 (28:16:05 \- 33:07:05):** Uh, and also, uh, he, he said his, he suggested in the email offered in the, in, in his not email message in LinkedIn, Amazon voucher. So how does this work? I asked him, but he didn't reply, so I was wondering. 

**Speaker 0 (33:16:05 \- 35:24:25):** No, no worries. Yeah. At the end of the interview, you will get, uh, um, uh, Amazon voucher on your email. I I, I will. 

**Speaker 1 (35:36:45 \- 36:03:35):** Alright. It's on, it is by email. 

**Speaker 0 (36:20:45 \- 37:33:35):** Yeah. Uh, if you have any other preferred way we can follow that. No, no, 

**Speaker 1 (37:33:35 \- 39:38:55):** It's fine. If I, yeah, if I can redeem it through email. That's all right. I was just wondering how, how it'll, how it'll be processed. 

**Speaker 0 (39:44:35 \- 41:25:35):** No. Yeah. At the end of the interview, I will go to your Amazon business account and I'll, uh, send it to your email address. Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (41:30:05 \- 63:17:25):** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh, my, my currently main, uh, occupation, uh, so to speak is, uh, is that I'm, uh, finishing my PhD on, on business management, on, on small business growth, uh, particularly the, the startups. Uh, well, first 10 years of, uh, of organizational development and growth. So that's the research I'm doing academically. But also for, for many years I've been doing market research for, uh, clients from different countries. I'm Lithuanian originally, so I, I did extensive market researches for, for foreign, uh, clients there. And then I moved to uk to UK because of a business. And also I did market research is, uh, here for Lithuanian and German clients. I worked in Germany for a while doing similar things as a consultant or, or, uh, part-time employee who was, uh, helping to and, and development of, of, of a, of a starting business. Right. So that's, uh, background in short. 

**Speaker 0 (63:37:45 \- 70:38:15):** Thank you very much. Yeah. That's a very interesting, uh, uh, set of studies you have, you work in industry and now you are, uh, in academia. So please feel free to use examples from both sectors when I ask, uh, questions. So for, for example, uh, could you please tell us a bit more about the use for artificial intelligence in your research? Like in your current research, or if you have also used it in your previous role in market research? 

**Speaker 1 (70:52:55 \- 73:34:25):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> No, I, I haven't used it previously because, uh, it was simply not there yet. 

**Speaker 0 (73:38:35 \- 73:44:25):** Right. 

**Speaker 1 (74:12:35 \- 83:16:25):** So it's, uh, it's rather recent development. And, uh, as far as my research is concerned, uh, no, not at the moment. Uh, I, I'm not excluding the possibility, but, uh, but my research simply does not require anything like that. I'm, I'm using, uh, some software for data analysis, but, uh, but that doesn't include, uh, machine learning tools, uh, because, uh, it's just simply not required. 

**Speaker 0 (83:25:35 \- 84:54:25):** Yeah. And is, is that a qualitative data or quantitative data and 

**Speaker 1 (85:07:55 \- 86:58:45):** Qualitative interviews, but also quantitative, uh, data in terms of, uh, 

**Speaker 0 (87:26:45 \- 87:35:05):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, 

**Speaker 1 (87:46:45 \- 102:48:45):** Uh, spreadsheets and, uh, and, uh, annual returns. So turnover information is quantitative, but my interviews were like, this one, I assume Dave said it's a survey. Uh, and as far as I understand, this will be interview. So it's not technically a survey. Survey would be a questionnaire where you ask questions and I reply yes or no, or provide very specific information, or I rate from a scale of five, one to five or five or one to seven certain phenomena or, or, or, or my impression of certain things. That's a survey. What we are doing now here is, uh, an interview, which is qualitative interview. Yeah, just a clarification. He mentioned survey in, in his message. It's not a survey. 

**Speaker 0 (103:09:15 \- 106:00:45):** Okay. Right. Thanks. Yeah, sorry about that. So, sweet. So the surveys are not just sending a link for, to somebody to fill it up, but, uh, people also interview each other to get the survey. Also, 

**Speaker 1 (106:09:15 \- 111:48:05):** Also sending a link, but a survey can be, can be done in person where you just answer questions, but the questions are preset. You have a certain questions and you don't ask open questions like, tell me about this or tell me about that. Uh, that's, that's qualitative interview. Survey is, is, is strictly quantitative. 

**Speaker 0 (112:02:15 \- 112:53:25):** Right. Okay. Yeah. Sorry about that misunderstanding. 

**Speaker 1 (113:00:25 \- 114:53:25):** No, it's, it's, okay. I, I, I'm in research, so this is my, my, my daily, daily job. No, 

**Speaker 0 (114:53:25 \- 115:08:05):** Yeah. Thank you. 

**Speaker 1 (115:09:45 \- 117:15:25):** But I understand that some people may, may mix them up and they, they say survey where it's just an interview. Right. All the other way around. 

**Speaker 0 (117:36:35 \- 123:52:45):** Okay. \<laugh\>. Great. Thanks. And, and for, uh, uh, qualitative research interviews that you're taking, uh, uh, can you tell us a little bit more, uh, how do you find the participant? How do you plan your project and, uh, uh, how do you decide about data collection and data analysis, that, what kind of tool you have to use? 

**Speaker 1 (124:11:35 \- 144:45:45):** There was a, uh, well, uh, in my research design, I, I, I specified, uh, uh, the research, uh, uh, sample. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. And, and then based on that, I approached, uh, small businesses. 'cause I'm interested in only in small business development, organic or natural development, not, uh, not, not, uh, investments, but, uh, development from turnover. And then I emailed, uh, some business to some businesses I'm emailed, others I phoned or even, uh, went to, to the premises in person, which tends to be a, a useful thing because they, they tend to appreciate your effort in, uh, trying to approach them. So if you come in person, if you show, uh, that you are really interested and not just, uh, not, not just an anonymous email, then they tend to, to give you their time. And also that was, these were in person interviews. So that was, uh, 2019 where, where there were no restrictions. 

**Speaker 1 (144:46:04 \- 167:38:05):** And then I traveled to, uh, to other cities. I, my, my sample included businesses from New York, London, and Berlin. So I did everything I did in person. And then, well, you can call it a mach, you can call it a machine learning tool or, or artificial intelligence, uh, as you, as you call it. Uh, I used, uh, for interview processing, I used, uh, a tool called, uh, Otter, O-T-T-E-R. Yeah. ai. Right. So that is, that is at that point when, when it was 2019, 2020, this was not a buzzword ai. So it was just a, just a tool that, that, that is self-learning up to a point. And that was very useful by the way, uh, because it saved, uh, it saves a lot of time for researchers, both market and academic researchers who interviewed people like you are doing now. And then you need to transcribe those interviews in order to find certain teams, certain themes or certain subjects that, uh, that were discussed or simple or, or simply just words. 

**Speaker 1 (167:47:15 \- 183:03:25):** Then you, then you, you upload, uh, your interview in, uh, in word format, or I think they used word ai, uh, auto AI used word format. And then, uh, it trans, it, it, it transcribes everything. Excuse me. You send the audio file and then you can, no, that was the other way around. You, of course, you send the audio file and then auto transcribes it, and then you can choose how to save it, whether it's Word or PDF, but also, uh, it's not precise as, as, as, as in case of any machines. They're not precise to, to the point of, uh, uh, of, to the satisfactory point. So I needed to, uh, to look through all of the transcribed interviews and then make adjustments while listening to the recordings. 

**Speaker 0 (183:12:15 \- 190:17:15):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, right? Yeah. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yeah, I know that too. That's very interesting. Indeed. Uh, but I'm wondering that, uh, most people use those tools for online meetings. Uh, but are you saying that, uh, you have used ot, uh, for offline meeting as well, when you were talking to people in person, and then you will recording, you were taking the voice recording, and then you will go back to your office and then Yeah. You will do that. Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (190:25:45 \- 199:14:05):** Yeah. Yeah. They, they definitely developed over the years because, uh, back then it was, like I said, 2019, 2020 when I was transcribing, uh, these interviews, probably now they are offering some other services, but back then it was, uh, it was, uh, it was just, uh, just, uh, uh, just, uh, taking a, taking a recording. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, and then, uh, changing it into, into a text. 

**Speaker 0 (199:32:25 \- 199:37:15):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (199:52:15 \- 205:50:15):** And that, that, that was done online. I did it online, yeah. But, uh, I, I had to connect to, uh, to, to the website to do it. I had to have an account. Yeah. But, uh, but yeah, I, I interviewed people using, uh, using, uh, an iPhone. 

**Speaker 0 (205:59:15 \- 207:12:55):** Mm-hmm. \<affirmative\>. Right. Great. Thanks. And, uh, 

**Speaker 1 (207:25:35 \- 208:04:55):** Mp, MP free, MP free format, I mean. 

**Speaker 0 (208:06:25 \- 209:59:35):** Right. And after 2019, have you explored any other tool or you're still using gotter? 

**Speaker 1 (210:17:55 \- 217:54:15):** No, I'm not using anything at the moment because I'm, I'm now in, uh, in the process of, uh, of, uh, making final revisions, post examination revisions. So I don't need it at the moment, but, uh, but of course, if I continue doing qualit qua qualitative research, I, I will definitely use, uh, order or maybe some, some other tool. My professor suggested auto, so that's how I found about it. 

**Speaker 0 (218:00:05 \- 225:06:55):** Yeah. And, uh, when you were uploading your audio recording Twitter and getting transcription, uh, can you tell me a little bit more what kind of further information you found really useful as the end product, uh, for that, uh, exercise? Uh, did you get like, uh, summaries, uh, like a word cloud or what kind of outputs it was giving to you that you found really interesting? 

**Speaker 1 (225:10:35 \- 231:43:15):** No, no, no. For, no, it, it, it, it does not, it does not, uh, uh, uh, well, I don't know what about now, but, uh, as far as I, I know audit still doesn't do that. It's, uh, it's, it's, it's data processing. So for that, I used the, well, in this case, not, not quantitative. I didn't need SPSS, but I used NVivo. 

**Speaker 0 (231:59:25 \- 232:04:15):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (232:18:35 \- 258:30:35):** But NVivo is, it's technically not a, not a machine learning tool. It's just a program where you, where you upload your, your, your texts, your interviews, and, and then they, they can provide it, it can provide, uh, things that you mentioned, like word trees, or they can find specific words or phrases. It can find specific words or phrases in the text. Yeah. But, uh, author, no. For ot, I only U author, I only use to, to transcribe the data. What I, what I, what was interesting with OT is that, uh, even, even when there were, uh, native English speakers, both in the United States, in the United States, it used to catch a little bit more and, and it was more precise. But, uh, uh, here in England, accent is a little different. So there were some issues I needed to, to make quite a few revisions. And then I sent it, I sent the file because one of my respondents wanted to have interviews, so I sent it to him, and he also, he found some more mistakes there. I said, no, that's different. And as far as Germans are concerned, for example, uh, uh, that involved more work because they, it, it didn't catch, uh, accents very well. So that's what I was missing. It would be good to to, to teach us to, to catch more accents. Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (258:54:05 \- 259:10:55):** Yeah. Of course. I mean, if you, 

**Speaker 1 (259:10:55 \- 261:45:35):** You, you understand if you are not a native speaker, and then if you speak it, it may not, uh, uh, recognize certain, uh, words that you are saying. 

**Speaker 0 (261:53:25 \- 262:20:15):** Yeah. Right. And 

**Speaker 1 (262:23:15 \- 262:39:35):** Or misinterpret them. 

**Speaker 0 (262:54:45 \- 270:18:35):** Sure, sure. I mean, the whole, uh, summarization after that depends on how well it understood the first word. Otherwise, it can change the whole context of the game. And, uh, about the method of, uh, data collection, like you said that you were traveling across the globe to talk to people in person and then recording the, uh, audios. Uh, what, what, why did you pick up that method when, uh, you could have done it online? How? 

**Speaker 1 (270:42:15 \- 281:52:15):** Oh, that, that makes math, makes the data much richer. That's the point of research that you have to go to. It's called field research. You're not just sitting in the room. You, you also make some observations that are useful. I also observed how businesses are, what, what, what kind of premises are there, how people work, and, uh, and how owner managers interviewed only owner managers, how owner managers, uh, present themselves there. That is all useful online on screen. Uh, now it's a bit more common. And, uh, 

**Speaker 0 (282:07:55 \- 283:08:05):** Yeah, COVID basically pushed everybody in that direction. So I'm wondering that 

**Speaker 1 (283:09:15 \- 292:23:55):** It's a little, I I, sometimes you can do it. If it's just a, just a short interview like we are doing, or some, or even shorter interviews, then yes. But, but my interviews were from one hour, anything from one hour to three hours. And these were in depth interviews with people who are generally quite busy. So, and it's the same thing again, if you are showing, uh, real interest, and if you're showing that you're making an effort, then, then people are, people tend to help you. 

**Speaker 0 (292:36:05 \- 303:05:25):** Right. And after 2019, since a lot of, you know, things changed, covid pushed a lot of people to go more online. Uh, and I totally agree with your explanation that, uh, field research is a bit more realistic when you're actually there in person. Uh, but after that, uh, I'm sure people might have explored the possibility that to find a tool that can give them as realistic as possible experience of field research, even, uh, online, have you come across any tool that can, uh, that can give you as close as possible experience as field research, but online. 

**Speaker 1 (303:58:35 \- 323:50:35):** But how can you, you need someone with a camera working all around unless, uh, unless there are these, uh, unless you mean these platforms, uh, such as we are using now, uh, the Google talk or Zoom, or used to be Skype. Skype, but now it's almost gone. So teams, those things. But, uh, but if you're doing field research, or in my case, these were interviews, but if you, if you're doing observation, if you're using ethnographic, ethnographic, uh, uh, uh, research design, then, uh, then you need to observe it yourself, how things are, and sometimes time it, so how much time does this take? How much time does it take from, to go from point A to point B term in when it's, uh, uh, when, uh, when we're talking about factories, how people are moving and research is on efficiency, for example. Uh, what, what obstacles are there in place or how they're communicating all this? 

**Speaker 0 (324:02:45 \- 324:08:35):** Right? 

**Speaker 1 (324:18:45 \- 332:11:55):** There, there, there were some, there, there was, there were some, some studies that, uh, that used cameras. So they, they were putting cameras in offices. Yeah, that is, that is possible. But, uh, but it depends on research design. Sometimes you just simply need to be there in place yourself, because you, you, you're the one who is gonna process the data, not a machine, and you're going to write about it. 

**Speaker 0 (332:26:05 \- 337:29:25):** Right. And when you say observation, uh, and the things that are impossible to understand just by talking to them are, do, do, do you mean having a better understanding about their facial expressions or the sentiments, uh, that are carried out with words, 

**Speaker 1 (337:51:55 \- 343:44:15):** Including that also, but, uh, but things that, but not necessarily can be captured on camera. So unless a camera follows a person, you know? Right. You can install a camera in a, in an office or in a, in a workshop. Uh, but, uh, 

**Speaker 0 (344:10:55 \- 351:29:45):** Right. Can, can, can you gimme some example, just like some concrete example? I, I understand your overall picture that we really need to be there. I'm just trying to understand, not fully replace the in-person interview, but let's say just in case, if someone want to get like, as close as possible experience, uh, what are your thoughts that, what could be still move to online, or what else we can do? 

**Speaker 1 (352:14:35 \- 370:23:55):** One option could be, uh, installing a camera. If we're talking about factory, for example, where workers are, are wearing headset, uh, some, some, some helmets or, or caps, installing a camera there, a little one so that if someone agrees to take part in your research, then everybody knows that he's wearing, he's wearing a cap or, or a, or a helm with a, with a camera installed. And, uh, if, let's say, I want to, to see, my, my research question is how, how is, uh, how is the, the owner manager organizing his or her day? Yeah. So, so then he or she would be wearing all, all, all the camera pins to, to a jacket or, or, 

**Speaker 0 (370:41:25 \- 370:45:05):** Yep. 

**Speaker 1 (371:03:25 \- 376:45:15):** Or, or an overcoat also. That would be an option. And then it would be the way you are following them. But then you would also need to, if it's a facial expression, like you mentioned, you also need another camera to, to, to check the facial expression or, or, or what that person is doing. 

**Speaker 0 (377:02:05 \- 377:07:55):** Right. 

**Speaker 1 (377:16:55 \- 377:29:15):** Uh, thanks. 

**Speaker 0 (377:40:55 \- 385:13:55):** And, uh, let, let's say that, uh, you have collected data. Uh, you have, uh, you, you, you have done the profiling, what kind of, uh, participant you want. You have a very nice description of a project. You collected your data. So now can you tell me a bit more about the data analysis and data visualization part? What kind of tool you mostly use and, uh, what kind of, uh, metrics you really want to see at data visualization part? 

**Speaker 1 (385:41:35 \- 388:05:35):** I used, uh, InVivo. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> software called InVivo for, for qualitative data processes. You know, n 

**Speaker 0 (388:18:05 \- 388:54:55):** Yeah, I, I'm familiar with that, yes. Oh, 

**Speaker 1 (388:54:55 \- 404:47:15):** Okay. Yeah. So that I used. But, uh, but I used, I used it mostly to, to systematize the data I needed to, to do a lot of, uh, a lot of data analysis myself, not, not, not through machine, but myself, because, uh, I was looking at, uh, at, uh, that some, uh, hidden factors that influence, uh, successful organizational development. So it's not just words I was looking for, but I was looking for meanings. Yeah. And, uh, uh, that, uh, was not possible back then. And I'm not sure it is possible now. It has to some extent. It may be possible, yes. But it's, it's the same thing as interpreting tools to translation tools. 

**Speaker 1 (405:24:15 \- 422:13:25):** You need to have a up to a point. You can do that. Yes. Yes. It can be helpful as a, uh, as an assistant, but still you need to supervise it all. As I mentioned with, uh, with interview transcriptions, that you have to check the files, you have to check that product yourself to make sure that everything is done correctly. So, so something, something to capture meanings. Yes. If I, if I, let's say, had a, had a program where I could, uh, where I could put in a command that I'm looking for certain metrics or certain meanings, and then it, it could make suggestions from which I then could choose the most correct one, and then it could learn to, to find that pattern in all, all around interviews, across the interviews, because I, I did 34 interviews, so that was, uh, 1000 pages of text. 

**Speaker 1 (422:51:05 \- 447:14:05):** So if I could do, could have done just one interview, the help of, of this, for example, finding, finding, uh, I was looking for themes. Initially. I was looking for themes and then grouping them into aggregates, and then, you know, and then into, into, into high abstraction aggregates. So that is, that can be done by a machine that is, that is, that is clear grouping, grouping themes. But, but finding, uh, themes in the text, uh, but not just words. And we've always good in finding words up to five, used to be five make mostly makes sense, five words after the word or before the word that, that before the search word and after the search word. But then a meaning, let's say, uh, I had some, I had some i a priori themes that comes from literature in, in, uh, in academic research. So if, if, uh, if, let's say a theme is efficiency. Yeah. Those, they, they, the interviewers, interviewees don't necessarily use the word efficiency, but you have to infer from what they're saying that this counts as efficiency or that counts as inefficiency. So that would've been helpful. 

**Speaker 0 (447:48:15 \- 447:54:05):** Right. 

**Speaker 1 (447:59:25 \- 452:55:55):** A tool like that to capture meanings and to, to look for, to look for, well in that case, or I can say behavioral patterns or, or linguistic patterns or, or, or, or, or, uh, or semantic patterns in what they're saying. 

**Speaker 0 (453:26:45 \- 464:49:55):** Right. Thanks. And yeah, that's very interesting insight. And, uh, at the end of the product, uh, let's say you have data visualization, and then you want to share your finding with the, with other experts or people, uh, like your supervisor, or if you're in market research already, then people are in the management letter. So can you give, uh, some examples that, uh, how the information is usually exchanged? Did you usually prefer to show like charts, graphs or, or more words and information like, uh, very, uh, small summaries, like in PowerPoint slides, how the, 

**Speaker 1 (465:05:55 \- 483:58:35):** Well, well, it depends. Uh, in a PhD, I had to use everything. I also, uh, uh, as an appendix, I, I included, uh, the, the whole, uh, the whole thematic template, uh, with the themes. Uh, and then, uh, and then tables with, uh, with some financial data or, or data or, or information about participants in general. So their age and, uh, their experience, years of, of experience and education, all that. PowerPoint slides, that would be more, or, or, or, or just slides in general? Uh, uh, a more succinct version of, uh, of it would be, would be conference presentation. Um, I will present my research in a, in a business management conference in here in the UK in September. So for that, I will prepare PowerPoints. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> slides. 

**Speaker 0 (484:27:35 \- 489:39:25):** Yeah. Right. Thanks. And, uh, so like you mentioned that you've used data like in 2019, and then it's mostly hands-on experience, and you're trying to get the themes and the sentiment by yourself by looking at the words and understanding them more. Uh, but now the 

**Speaker 1 (489:39:25 \- 490:30:45):** 20 19, 20 2019, 2020\. 

**Speaker 0 (490:44:55 \- 499:03:05):** Right. Okay. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. And, and, uh, now if you have to like, do these qualitative research interview from, like planning the project, then finding the participant, then collecting data and analyzing and visualizing and, uh, then presenting. So in this whole chain, uh, where do you think, uh, AI could be more helpful to, uh, save your time and, uh, give you a bit more authentic information? Where do you see the AI application in this whole market research chain 

**Speaker 1 (499:24:45 \- 500:30:25):** Fi finding participants? Uh, uh, I doubt it. 

**Speaker 0 (500:36:05 \- 500:44:25):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. 

**Speaker 1 (501:12:35 \- 524:00:45):** Because unless it is, uh, unless it is, uh, it is, uh, it is random sampling. If it's random sampling, then, then could be, but then there are databases if it's random sampling. And then also you can use some programs like Python for, uh, for finding things online on the internet. So let's say I'm, I'm researching, uh, an antique business, antique shops, yeah. As an example. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, because restaurants are, um, more easy to find. There are, there are catalogs of restaurants, and then you, but, but if it's, if it's, let's say antique dealers, yeah. They're not necessarily registered as, uh, as, uh, as antique dealer dealers in, in, in some comprehensive catalog. So scanning the websites, scan scanning websites, scanning, uh, scanning different, uh, uh, databases and, uh, finding businesses that meet your criteria because you have to, you have to use certain criteria. Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (524:03:05 \- 548:13:15):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, let's say if you, if you limit your research to cities, so you have to, you have to input, uh, uh, London or York or Manchester. And then within those cities, all websites, all possible websites, scanning and looking for all possible businesses that are dealing in antiques. And at this point, because the problem with registers in, in, in certain businesses, I gave an example, which is, which is more difficult. There are lots of, uh, rexi rates are quite high. So if you, if we're talking about such businesses, then if, if there is a, if there is a database or a catalog, which is a few years old, they might not be there anymore. Or there may be some new ones, which you would be interested in as well. So that may be, that would be helpful. Uh, but I, I can tell you what, what it would be helpful, uh, in, in writing up, uh, not just thesis, also a research paper. Research article, empiric article. And that's, that's, that's what I've been thinking about as well, how to develop a tool like that, that it's the quotes, it's the quotations, references. 

**Speaker 0 (548:22:15 \- 548:36:05):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. 

**Speaker 1 (548:55:05 \- 576:49:05):** So you know that if you're writing academic work, ev, everything has to be, uh, referenced. And you have a, you have a large list of, of, of sources of references at the end of your work, whether it's a thesis or, or, or a, or, uh, an article. There are some tools that, uh, you can integrate in Word, for example, I, I don't remember now the name, but there is a certain tool where, which, which, once you insert a quotation, once you insert articles, once you have, uh, once you feed it, all the articles that you read that, that you, that you, uh, reference in your work, then if you, if you're writing, uh, uh, say that Smith and Smith say this and that, and then it automatically adds, it, uh, adds the source, yeah. In brackets, but it's not exactly precise. And I, I, I did it all manually. And as far as I, I know, uh, other researchers are also tend to do it manually in certain quotations, you know what I mean? Yes. In scientific literature, if you say that all, there is very little information on the subject of, uh, growth in small businesses, let's say. Yes. And then you have to, uh, to, to, to say whether it's your idea or whether it's somebody else's idea that you're using, you have to, to, to back up your, your statement. 

**Speaker 0 (576:56:54 \- 577:01:44):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (577:11:25 \- 582:07:45):** And then you, you have to add the, so I, I was thinking about, about the way to, to simplify this somehow, but it's, it's, it's, it's quite complicated. 

**Speaker 0 (582:27:44 \- 582:30:25):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (583:14:45 \- 590:40:45):** Because it has to be connected to internet. If you're writing something on, on, uh, in Word or, or Mac pages, then, uh, right. That's a problem because the current ones are not precise enough. And then it's, it's, it messes things up. And then there, there is some form, there are some formatting issues, and then you have to, to do it again yourself. So it's, 

**Speaker 0 (591:14:45 \- 593:14:55):** Yeah, I totally agree with you. That's very nice point. You raised it. Yeah. If we, uh, yeah, if, if, if we are, if there is a, 

**Speaker 1 (593:20:35 \- 593:58:45):** For referencing some tool for referencing 

**Speaker 0 (594:09:15 \- 603:59:55):** Sure. Yes. Some tool for references, uh, references and also like a bit more automatic and more authentic that, uh, uh, not just like chat GPT. If you ask it to give you something, it can still give you something, but you then you don't really believe it. It's basically just a draft and, uh, you have to crosscheck everything. And you might end up by saying that, oh, 90% is totally wrong. All the suggestions. Yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah, that was very interesting. Uh, point, do you have, uh, it was really nice talking to you. Uh, yeah. I clearly learned a lot. And, uh, do you have any other question for us? 

**Speaker 1 (604:44:25 \- 605:57:15):** Yeah. Uh, how, how old are you as business? 

**Speaker 0 (606:16:35 \- 631:10:45):** Uh, well, the company started, uh, actually, uh, three years ago, but officially started, uh, uh, we got the more than a million pound, uh, this year. Uh, we got like more than 450 k from Google. So we are collaborating with Google. So they, we are launching our first product, uh, most probably this September. So our idea is basically to, uh, reduce the time that people, uh, uh, in market research they're spending on this whole research journey. And we are developing a, a platform that will provide you end-to-end solutions. You start planning your project, then you, uh, find your participant, then you collect data. We have our own video recording tool. And then Ida here is, uh, equivalent to what you said about order. It'll give you transcriptions. Then, uh, it'll also give you summary and the percentage of time or, uh, highlights of your interview, the kind of question ask it. And then you can ask it questions back. If you have talked to somebody for an hour or longer, you built a lot of text. And, uh, then you can figure out that if you have already asked the right set of question or not. So at the end, uh, we will provide in-house, uh, data analysis functionalities as well. We will initially target for qualitative, but then, uh, we will move towards quantitative as well. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. 'cause I think Okay, 

**Speaker 1 (631:21:25 \- 632:18:35):** I see. Yes. Good. 

**Speaker 0 (632:32:25 \- 640:07:55):** Yeah, because, uh, like you mentioned that sometime you talk to people, then you also have a different kind of data. You also take spreadsheets. Uh, so we will make sure that because there is not a clear a hundred percent very well defined boundary between qualitative and quantitative when it comes to market research, you need a bit of both. So what we are trying to do is empowering qualitative researcher so they can do what they're good at instead of just, uh, spending time on admin related tasks. 

**Speaker 1 (641:04:45 \- 641:18:05):** I think that's useful. 

**Speaker 0 (641:30:35 \- 641:35:25):** Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (642:00:35 \- 660:41:25):** What did, what what, uh, I'm not sure if you are, if you are planning to develop something like that, but when I, when I was doing a, a market research, or let's say, let's say there was, uh, there was this, uh, software company from Estonia who wanted to enter UK market Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. And I was looking for, for, well, first I did a general research on, on how things are here, which, which does not require any tools, but then I needed to, to identify businesses that would, uh, interest in their particular service. Hmm. And, and the sample was, the sample population was, was quite big. Yeah. And it was up to me to decide. So, and then I would also go and visit businesses, uh, and, and talk to them and present the company first ask for an interview. But it took me a fair amount of time to, to just identify the, the businesses or let's say London area. Yeah. That would be useful. 

**Speaker 0 (660:58:25 \- 662:02:45):** No, I totally agree with you. That that's very interesting point because we spend, but 

**Speaker 1 (662:10:25 \- 662:27:25):** Yes, yes. Go on. Excuse me. 

**Speaker 0 (662:35:45 \- 669:06:55):** No, yeah. I, I, I'm saying that I agree that we spend a lot of time to find the right audience. So that's where AI can, AI and machine learning can help a lot to give you initial set and also like creating some kind of overlap with your critical requirements that, uh, how much is the overlap or how much is the match, uh, between your target and your, your requirement it. 

**Speaker 1 (669:30:25 \- 671:10:25):** Correct. Correct. Yeah. So something like that. 

**Speaker 0 (671:22:15 \- 675:04:25):** Yeah. Very good. Very good. Okay, great. Uh, uh, yeah, when we launch our product in September, we will definitely give you guys a heads up if you want to take a look and, uh Oh, 

**Speaker 1 (675:04:25 \- 676:21:45):** Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Please do. Yeah, please do. If I can be of any help. 

**Speaker 0 (676:34:35 \- 676:40:25):** Right. 

**Speaker 1 (676:42:55 \- 676:51:05):** Awesome. 

**Speaker 0 (677:06:35 \- 679:06:25):** Thank you very much. It was really interesting and really nice chatting with you. And, uh, I will follow up about the watch later after the email. 

**Speaker 1 (679:19:05 \- 679:39:05):** Likewise, \<inaudible\>. 

**Speaker 0 (679:46:45 \- 680:56:25):** Thanks a lot. Thank you. Have a nice rest of the day. 

**Speaker 1 (681:10:55 \- 681:56:25):** Yeah. Good luck with the project development. 

**Speaker 0 (682:06:55 \- 682:48:05):** Thank you very much. Bye-Bye. Very much. Bye.
