  
**Speaker 2 (1:33:25 \- 2:32:35):** Hello? Hi, Rob. Hello. Can you hear me well? 

**Speaker 1 (2:41:35 \- 2:49:15):** Uh, yep. 

**Speaker 2 (3:04:35 \- 3:27:25):** Very good. Thanks. How are you doing? 

**Speaker 1 (3:34:35 \- 3:52:05):** Yeah, all good to have you. 

**Speaker 2 (4:07:55 \- 12:53:25):** Good, good. Uh, yeah. Uh, so, uh, my name is, uh, re I'm a product manager in the research and Insights at Beings. It's a startup company. Uh, we are developing a AI products for market research. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. And, uh, our CEO Dave who was talking to you, he is, uh, he is on holiday now. It's only me, uh, talking today. Sure. We have another participant called ai. It's our, uh, tool, well AI tool that will, uh, be recording the meeting and then giving transcription at the end. Are you okay with that? 

**Speaker 1 (13:00:25 \- 13:10:05):** Yes, fine. 

**Speaker 2 (13:23:05 \- 18:01:34):** Thank you. Uh, okay. So yeah, we can start with the, uh, please, uh, tell me a little bit more about, uh, your job and, uh, what kind of work you do and, uh, what are your day-to-Day responsibilities? A little bit about that, and then I can start asking a bit more tailored questions. 

**Speaker 1 (18:11:25 \- 33:25:25):** Sure. Um, so I work at a company called Tain, uh, who own a number of gambling companies. Um, I'm a consumer insights manager for sportsbook. So a lot of my role is just working out, like, uh, getting a better understanding of consumers in general, um, and specifically our customers as well. So the main way we do that is through surveying either our customers or external, um, consumers. Uh, and it could be on like a range of different topics. So it could either be based on something that we're, um, planning as a wider business, or it could be based on like specific requests that come through from different teams. They might say, I wanna understand X, and then we'll basically design a questionnaire and send a survey out based on that and analyze the results for them and send them back. 

**Speaker 2 (34:05:45 \- 39:39:55):** Very good. Yeah. That's very interesting. Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. And, uh, it's like, if, if I look at your overall experience, you have quite a lot of experience at the big agencies like ips mm-hmm. \<affirmative\> and the yonder and then, and Change. So how do you see the use of technology or in particular AI is, uh, is different, uh, is different between these settings? 

**Speaker 1 (39:55:35 \- 47:29:15):** Um, to be honest, I didn't see it a lot when I was at agency side, so there wasn't, in my job, there wasn't a lot of use of it. But since coming to Tain, and particularly in the last sort of six months, um, there seems to be a lot of companies selling sort of tools that are aggregating data, for example, online through the use of ai. Um, it seems like a bit of a, a bit of a race to sort of monetize that at the moment, 

**Speaker 2 (47:50:15 \- 51:56:45):** But yeah, that's true. Uh, and, uh, with your, uh, in your current responsibilities, uh, what's the nature of your research? Is it mostly qualitative or you already deal with existing data sets? Like quantitative side? 

**Speaker 1 (52:11:45 \- 56:52:45):** So it's, it's predominantly quant, but we do some quite as well. Uh, it kind of depends on the request, but a lot of it'll be sort of new research. So what if we can get the answer from existing data, then we'll do that. But a lot of the time it requires new research from us. 

**Speaker 2 (57:15:55 \- 58:25:25):** Okay. Very good. And have you started, uh, using AI for any of these sites? 

**Speaker 1 (58:51:05 \- 62:17:25):** Um, not specifically for any of these yet. We have recently signed up to a couple of different sort of AI based platforms, um, but I haven't had much use of them yet. 

**Speaker 2 (62:25:35 \- 63:43:25):** Right, thanks. Could, uh, would it be, uh, possible for you to tell me the names of those platforms or, 

**Speaker 1 (64:00:25 \- 64:38:05):** Uh, probably not to be honest. 

**Speaker 2 (65:17:15 \- 73:27:45):** Okay. Right. And, uh, so like, this is, you said that's the gambling industry and you are, uh, studying consumer behavior. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. And every time the data could be a little bit different, uh, trying to understand the different aspect of that consumer behavior. And then for that project planning, do you always, uh, uh, do the planning by yourself or you take help from some behavioral scientist or some psychologist? 

**Speaker 1 (73:51:25 \- 81:04:35):** Um, not at the moment. That is something that we're starting to look more into in some of the work that we've got planned, but predominantly the, the stuff we do is, um, more about like, let's understand what customers think of this current product or something like that. So it's, um, a bit more straightforward. But some of the bigger pieces we've got planned, we are sort of involving behavioral psychology and yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (81:34:35 \- 89:38:25):** Right. Okay. Thanks. And, uh, would it be possible for you to gimme some kind of example of your work, uh, basically from product planning to data recording, data collection and yeah, this to the end, uh, basically the whole project journey where you have used any AI on the way, or if you think that, uh, it could be useful, uh, in some way if you haven't used it so far? 

**Speaker 1 (89:51:25 \- 104:34:05):** Yes. I think the, the main place that we would use it and have used it has been sort of as part of the initial brief. So the work tends to work as a stakeholder will send us a brief. We will then sort of interrogate that brief, um, to work out what's the best, uh, way to go forward to answer their questions. Um, then we'll also maybe use some of the AI tools that we've signed up to, to see if we can get any information on that already. Um, so if it was, for example, I had a request recently where someone just wanted to know, know sort of the percentage of gamers in the uk. So there was a couple of internal bits and pieces, bit, uh, bits and pieces that we had on that, but also could have used, uh, ai there didn't on that occasion, but that's sort of where it would come in in the project. Just sort of the initial brief and sort of scoping out some of the stuff that they wanna talk about. 

**Speaker 2 (104:48:25 \- 106:42:45):** Oh, very good. Thanks. And what do you think about, uh, the quality of suggestions or the participation of AI there? 

**Speaker 1 (107:03:45 \- 117:56:45):** Um, I say mixed. So some of the tools that we sign up to better than others, um, like I said, it, it does seem like a bit of a race at the moment. So I think a lot of the companies have sort of half built tools and they're not necessarily that user friendly or they don't necessarily show you exactly what you want. So there was an example of one the other day where they would demoing, um, how you'd find a certain number. And then the data that it pulled out was from like 2016\. And I was like, okay, well that's probably not really usable. It's eight years ago now. Uh, you had covid in between that. It's kind of redundant, but Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (118:11:55 \- 133:40:05):** Yeah, yeah, that's true. And, uh, what, uh, like this is a race, like you said that a lot of companies are trying to use? Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, uh, I mean, in in principle the foundation of ai, like data science, machine learning and many other things has been already around people were using. It's just the layer of generative AI that changed the whole perspective. And now everybody trying to use it because the applications become more clear. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. Uh, but depending on the industry size, for example, Ipsos or the other bigger companies, they might be developing their own tools and uh, sometime they're taking help from the other tool tools that are already existing in the market. Uh, so if, uh, you have to get into this race, uh, what would be your, uh, view, uh, would you prefer to develop something in-house by your company? Or you would be more confident to pick the best thing available in the market for ai? 

**Speaker 1 (134:00:25 \- 142:23:05):** Um, I'd say based on what I'm seeing at the moment, the preference would be in-house. But maybe that's because the products at the moment don't feel like they're fully finished. Um, I think in the future I'd probably prefer to pick the best product on the market, but at the moment I would probably prefer in-house just because I want to use it the way I want to use it. Um, yeah, I don't, I don't feel like the products that I've seen so far aren't that good. 

**Speaker 2 (142:59:25 \- 146:38:25):** So, so, uh, yeah. Thanks. Yeah, I totally understand. And that they're not that good from, um, uh, the features point of view, the, all the functionalities they're providing or, or the quality of information they are spitting out? 

**Speaker 1 (146:51:45 \- 158:28:25):** I'd say both. So quality of information is sometimes not very good, like the example that I just mentioned. But I'd say also because they are trying to sort of mass market a lot of these tools, they're not bespoke. It's a kind of one size fits all. Um, and I think also there's one in particular that, um, we've signed up that's sort of been developed for a particular market, so sort of more financial services. Um, so it's probably great for that. But as a gambling company, it's kind of okay and does a reasonable job, but is not gonna be bespoke to us. It's more tailored to the financial services companies 'cause that's mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> where most of their client base is. 

**Speaker 2 (158:38:15 \- 161:44:25):** Yeah. Right. Thanks. And can you, can you dig into more detail there that, what are your fear that you think, uh, could not be solved by AI specific to your industry? 

**Speaker 1 (162:07:05 \- 175:33:25):** So a lot of it is just around general numbers on, so for example, one of the big problems is finding market size of different brands for gambling companies because there's a lot of, there's a lot of different data sources that you can use. You can use survey data, which is often unreliable. There's also some companies that produce market size, but it's quite outdated, so they don't release it until like a year after. Um, so obviously it's quite difficult to find what you want. Now there's also sort of conflict in terms of market size. Do you want volume or do you want value? Obviously two very different things in our industry, like volume of players versus the value of those players. Um, so yeah, I think that that's probably one example that it can't solve at the moment. 

**Speaker 2 (175:59:05 \- 180:21:55):** Yeah. Right. Thanks. And, uh, so so you think that, uh, to get an answer to get decisions about these issues quicker, you will prefer the manual interference or humans over AI to give you the best fit? 

**Speaker 1 (180:47:05 \- 181:14:45):** Yes. For now, yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (181:28:15 \- 186:22:05):** Right. And, uh, what do you think about the use of synthetic data or simulations to simulate the behavior of consumers or trying to understand, uh, the, uh, uh, perception about it? Again, in, in some industry, uh, based on the past information, 

**Speaker 1 (186:38:55 \- 196:42:45):** Uh, I've not seen it done anywhere in anything I've used. I'd be open to looking at it. I think there'd probably be quite a lot of distrust in it if it is in fact data. But yeah, I mean, I think for me, it'd probably be one of those things that you'd have to run alongside maybe some research to look at validating how accurate that infect data was. So yeah, let's spit out the ECT data and then let's also run something alongside to, to validate that before we then use synthetic data in the future again. 

**Speaker 2 (196:58:15 \- 203:14:15):** Right. Thanks. And at some point you mentioned about, uh, that the, some of the A tools was trained on 2016 data and you didn't trust it because it was too long, uh, too long ago. Uh, so is your data very frequently changing and it's really fast paced and uh, you can rarely use the old information? Is it, uh, the nature of your research? 

**Speaker 1 (203:34:15 \- 209:44:25):** Yeah, so in terms of that specific example, that day would've changed a lot. Like Covid had a massive impact in mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> in the industry. So, uh, it would've changed a lot. There's also regularly sort of new entrant to the market, um, that can have an impact as well. So the 2016 data would've been, yeah, redundant. 

**Speaker 2 (210:06:25 \- 222:17:25):** Right. Thanks. And, uh, so yeah, like it, I, I think slowly in the coming years, I, I'm hearing a lot of, uh, distrust about the quality of the information and, uh, also the way, uh, AI tool are friendly, user friendly or not friendly or too way too complex for using. So there are certain, uh, reasons for resistance there. Mm-Hmm. But I think these things will be overcome in next few years. Uh, but in that kind of ideal scenario, uh, what kind of problem you think, uh, you can think of that could be solved by, by ai, uh, rather than, uh, spending human time there can, can you think? Um, 

**Speaker 1 (222:33:25 \- 231:31:25):** I think it'd predominantly be sort of desk research in my role. So it would save a lot of time in desk research if these things worked better. So at the moment, they basically, the ones that I've seen are basically the same as doing a Google search. Um, they're not necessarily much better than that. Um, obviously you don't get the ads at the top. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same from my perspective. So I think that would be the biggest use case for it in the future. Just saving a lot of time on desk research and background information. 

**Speaker 2 (232:02:55 \- 236:38:45):** Right. Yeah. Thanks. Just to understand a bit more about dex uh, research. So, so your definition of desk research is like when you're planning the project, uh, finalizing the information or you're talking about analysis at the end? Because I think, uh, depending on the job role, the desk research could be different. Meaning 

**Speaker 1 (236:49:15 \- 247:48:05):** Yeah, it could be, could be both. So it could be for me getting additional context on maybe a brief that they're asking for. Or if someone comes to me and wants a quick turnaround of number, like the, the gamers example that I gave, if they said how many gamers are in the uk, that's something that I could probably quickly do with ai. But I would also say if someone comes to me with a brief that I think probably the data already exists in like the external world and on the internet, that's definitely something that I could use AI for and go, okay, this is my question, what is the answer to that? And then use that analysis. 

**Speaker 2 (248:13:45 \- 255:22:35):** Yeah. Right. Thanks. And, uh, about, uh, the ethical side of the things, uh, uh, have you encountered any ethical challenge or concern, uh, when using AI in the research or, uh, especially regarding participant data or potential biases in AI algorithm? Can you gimme some example if you have experienced or if you are just concerned about the future? 

**Speaker 1 (255:36:15 \- 270:11:05):** So I think I haven't really experienced any problems, but I think the main concern is just about how much, um, we use AI and how much information we feed it. So I obviously deal with like personal information of, um, customers and consumers, for example. So there's, I think that would be my main skepticism, like how much data can I feed it, do I trust it, that it's gonna keep that data safe and protect it? If I did feed it that information, obviously I wouldn't at the moment it's obviously our policy not to do that sort of stuff and push that out. But I think that would probably be the danger in the future that people could easily, uh, get that data if people use it, like putting it in the wrong place and then yeah, it could be taken basically or stolen by someone online. 

**Speaker 2 (270:45:45 \- 278:11:45):** Right. Okay. And, uh, when you're dealing with this customer research, uh, uh, what, what do you think how much AI could help there to provide personalized experience, uh, for, for customers? Do you usually just analyze the data or the result of your data are also used to provide personalization, uh, experience to, to your users as well? 

**Speaker 1 (278:27:35 \- 285:43:05):** Yeah, they can be. So a lot of the time what, what my job is, is to basically analyze the data and provide insight on and recommendations on what the different teams should do with that insight. Um, it's then their job to sort of build that personalization, if that is the example of build a new product or whatever the insight might be. Um, but yeah, I sort of passed that part onto them. 

**Speaker 2 (286:00:15 \- 291:09:54):** Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. Right. Thanks. And, uh, for qualitative research, can you, uh, highlight, uh, some of the, uh, key insights that, uh, you usually draw from that research? Uh, what are the main messages you want to see from the qualitative research? 

**Speaker 1 (291:30:15 \- 294:29:25):** Um, I don't really have an answer to that. I've not really done a lot of qualitative research in my careers. It's predominantly been quant. 

**Speaker 2 (295:01:45 \- 296:38:05):** No, yeah. Sorry. Uh, I then probably misunderstood. You mentioned in the beginning, uh, that there was a bit of qual involved. 

**Speaker 1 (296:42:35 \- 297:33:25):** Yeah, there's a bit of call, but uh, yeah, not much. 

**Speaker 2 (297:41:45 \- 298:54:05):** So is there like somebody else doing that and you rely on the results? Uh, 

**Speaker 1 (299:02:35 \- 300:16:45):** Yeah. So usually it'll be a, an agency that we'd hire to do that sort of stuff. 

**Speaker 2 (300:37:05 \- 303:12:45):** Oh, okay. So for all the numbers related stuff and quant related stuff, you are doing it in, in-house and for anything qualitative, you hire an agency and did they try to provide you 

**Speaker 1 (303:37:15 \- 312:56:05):** Yeah, for the, for the quantity sort of half and half. So half of it we'll do in-house, half of it will probably hire an agency. It depends who we need to speak to. So obviously we have access to our own customers. So if it's specifically about our customers, we can usually do the research ourself. If we need to speak to like a wider consumer base, then we'll have to engage with an agency to help us do that. Um, qualitative, we tend to go through agencies. 'cause within my team we don't really have the skillset of qualitative. We're predominantly quant researchers. 

**Speaker 2 (313:27:35 \- 318:59:55):** Oh, okay. Right. And, uh, what if in the coming days, uh, there is a, uh, some AI platform, uh, that can, uh, empower you from qual research point of view as well, will you be interested to explore or you will stay, uh, in the way you're working now that always are sourcing to agency? 

**Speaker 1 (319:16:35 \- 324:38:35):** I think if there, there was something available, I'd definitely be interested. I just dunno what that would look like. So I suppose maybe it comes back to your earlier point about like infect data. Like if there's something quality that you could produce that could then be translated into a quant number, that's something that would be really interesting, I think, to us. 

**Speaker 2 (324:46:25 \- 331:48:15):** Yeah. Right, right. Very good. Thanks. And let's say that, uh, uh, you have asked the agency to provide something they carried on their qualitative research then in what format or, uh, they, in, in what format they communicate their results back to you? Uh, like the, uh, word document, PowerPoint presentation, PDFs, how do they share their observation and Yes. 

**Speaker 1 (332:00:45 \- 335:07:35):** Yeah, usually PowerPoint. Um, so that tends to be the way we present internally. So it'll usually be a PowerPoint that we'd review and then it would then get presented back to stakeholders. 

**Speaker 2 (335:31:25 \- 342:12:25):** And so there's like usually less information in the slides than a proper document and you have asked somebody to do the research. So they have, they are sharing only the final information with you. And if you have a follow up question, how do you access the, the follow up information? Is it like, do, do you get the access to some kind of dashboard where you can see more information or, um, you get the information out of the agency? 

**Speaker 1 (342:27:25 \- 349:42:45):** Um, usually just by asking them to be honest. So if it's not on the deck, then yeah, it would just be a case of we've got these follow-ups. Uh, so the way it would usually work, they would present or I would present would then go back out to the stakeholders a week or two later mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> just to check in and say, is there anything else that you needed that's come up since, um, pass that back to the agency and then we'd get them to answer those. 

**Speaker 2 (349:59:55 \- 353:00:05):** Very good. Thanks. And can you tell me a little bit more about the expertise of these stakeholders? Uh, are those always, um, or management board or if I'm missing something? 

**Speaker 1 (353:09:55 \- 364:16:35):** Yeah, so they'll, it'll usually just be people from different teams. So they might be, uh, they may be working in like the marketing team for example, and they wanna test an ad, um, or they may be in the product team and they want to test one of our products. So their expertise will be on the actual product they'll, or the ad they'll tell us how it works, what they're trying to do with it. And then it's basically our job to test whatever they want us to test. So if they, if if it was just general like, test the performance of this ad, this is what we're trying to do with then design the research around getting them the best answers to whatever questions they want. Mm-Hmm. 

**Speaker 2 (364:17:15 \- 371:04:55):** \<affirmative\>. Yeah. Right. Thanks. And, uh, can I ask a little bit more about the metrics or the kind of information you see in those PowerPoint presentations? This is usually like transcription or sentiment analysis or what, what, what are the different kind of metrics that you see in those presentations from agency? 

**Speaker 1 (371:14:35 \- 371:18:15):** Uh, 

**Speaker 2 (371:27:05 \- 371:48:55):** Gimme an overview of the things 

**Speaker 1 (371:56:35 \- 372:16:55):** In qual or qu? 

**Speaker 2 (372:25:15 \- 372:57:35):** Uh, yeah, in both. Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (373:01:55 \- 373:12:55):** In both. So 

**Speaker 2 (373:24:15 \- 373:39:35):** Qu Yeah. First. Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (373:51:55 \- 388:15:35):** In Qual I would say it's predominantly just their interpretation. So the main qual that I've done since I've been here has been focus groups. Yeah. So it's predominantly just their interpretation of the group as a, a whole, uh, what the key findings were. Um, and sort of any recommendations that they have around like improvements. Um, for Quant it's obviously a bit more specific. So a lot of stuff will be doing will be like, um, appeal, how much they like a product or don't like it, why or why not they don't like it. Like are they likely to play again in the future? Um, why are they using certain brands over our brands? Uh, what makes 'em choose a brand? Like it's all that sort of stuff. Yeah. Usage, consideration or those sort of metrics 

**Speaker 2 (388:44:05 \- 401:36:05):** And yeah. Right. Thanks. And do they try to give you like additional information on top of, so these are the things you mentioned are, we can call them key insights of a meeting, the main lessons that you've learned. Uh, but other than that, do they try to give you the sentiment analysis or the tone of the meeting or people were happy or sad or when they talked about some product feature they were extra happy or some additional information like, uh, like you trying to make sure that, oh, you are also sitting there in the focus group and uh, it's not just a presentation, they try to take with them, uh, a bit more personalized experience, uh, providing information in a way that, oh, you are not missing anything. You got the key insight, but then you also got something on top. So I'm wondering what was in addition to key insights? 

**Speaker 1 (401:47:45 \- 405:19:55):** So tone of, I'd say yes, that would definitely be given like part the agency on the focus groups for example. But sentiment analysis, no, it's not something I've ever done, uh, since I've been here. Mm-Hmm. 

**Speaker 2 (405:20:55 \- 407:32:15):** \<affirmative\>. Right. Thanks. And, uh, at the end of those presentations, have you ever felt like if there was something more that's usually missing? 

**Speaker 1 (408:05:25 \- 412:40:25):** Uh, not really. Most of the agencies we use are pretty good. So we've, we've kind of built out a roster of good agencies over the last couple of years. So yeah, the bad ones don't tend to come back and get any work from us again. 

**Speaker 2 (412:59:05 \- 418:41:35):** \<laugh\>. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Thanks. And, uh, can you, can you tell a little bit more about the quant results as well? If you ever hire agency, uh, do they run service for you or They still run qualitative interview, but you get information only in terms of, uh, tables, plots or spreadsheets? 

**Speaker 1 (418:57:15 \- 435:49:35):** Um, so they will run surveys for us as well if we have an agency. So that would be if we wanted to contact people that weren't our customers. Um, in terms of access to the data, the agencies that we use are pretty transparent with that. So if I said I wanna see the raw data, they'd happily send that to me. If I wanted to do my own analysis again, they'd be quite willing to let me do that. Um, is a very collaborative approach. So the way that I tend to work with the main agency I work with on quant is, um, I'll be having sort of weekly catchups with them. They'll be telling me everything that's going on, what stage they're at in terms of field work, et cetera. In the analysis stage. We'll probably have a couple of meetings just, they'll start it off and basically say, look, this is what we think. Is there anything you can think of internally that like, does this ring true? Does it not? Is there anything else that you want us to look at? So yeah, I'd say it's very collaborative and they're quite transparent. Mm-Hmm, 

**Speaker 2 (435:50:15 \- 440:00:55):** \<affirmative\>. Right, thanks. And, uh, if we talk about the tools used for quantitative analysis, uh, do you also have, uh, tools developed by your company or you mostly rely on the outside quantitative analysis tools in the market? 

**Speaker 1 (440:17:55 \- 451:38:05):** Uh, so it's a mix. Um, not in my team specifically, but there are teams within the business that, um, have created dashboards, for example, or, um, sort of big Excel sheets with like sort of pivot tables where you can sort of drag and drop different, um, sort of financial metrics and stuff like that if you wanted to see anything in particular. So yeah, but then we also rely on external data. So we've got a few dashboards that we're signed up to in terms of like consumer data where we can look into it and get a quick answer on different things if we need it. So more sort of attitudinal, um, yeah, stuff like that. 

**Speaker 2 (451:58:25 \- 458:16:15):** Right. Thanks. And, uh, if we came out of, uh, the type of research but focus more on your project management that how many people, different kind of stakeholders you have to talk to, uh, do you think at your project management level, AI could be helpful? Uh, and save you some time? If you can gimme some examples, how it can save your time at your management level? 

**Speaker 1 (458:41:35 \- 459:34:35):** Um, save me time in terms of dealing with stakeholders? 

**Speaker 2 (459:49:05 \- 462:13:55):** Yeah, dealing with stakeholders, talking about project result interpretation, uh, uh, basically all kind of meetings that you have with people around you or with agencies. 

**Speaker 1 (462:35:45 \- 468:11:15):** Yeah, so I think it, it would mainly be maybe in how the results were accessed. So if they could almost self-serve a lot of the results, if we were able to give them access to a platform that had answers to their questions, um, that could maybe be a way to save time 'cause it would stop from coming to me. Um, 

**Speaker 2 (468:29:05 \- 468:33:55):** Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (468:42:25 \- 469:23:55):** Yeah, that's probably the main use case I can think of. 

**Speaker 2 (469:38:05 \- 475:10:15):** Uh, so right now the information is uh, uh, kind of as, uh, under uh, each person's authority or under each person's, uh, uh, responsibility. And if you want to know something, it's not like, uh, uh, openly available even within your company, it's like siloed information and 

**Speaker 1 (475:10:15 \- 482:22:55):** Correct. Yeah. So a lot of different departments hold different bits of information. So if I, if I want XI have to go to this team over here. And likewise, a lot of people will come to our team and say, have you got information on this? Uh, and it might be that we have to go somewhere else to get that, whether that's one of the platforms that we sign up to or one of someone in a different team that we know has that information. So yeah, it's quite disjointed I would say. 

**Speaker 2 (482:36:05 \- 484:09:05):** And, and we are still talking about the information that's strictly needed about different kind of research, right? 

**Speaker 1 (484:22:05 \- 491:28:25):** Yes, it could be, it could be anything. So the research information is kind of all held with us, but we, at the moment, we don't have a platform internally that we use to sort of publish that all. It's kind of, it will get sent to the individual stakeholder that requested it, but then if another stakeholder came to me the week after and said, oh, have you got this information that I'd already given to the other one the week before, I'd then have to sort of resend that again. 

**Speaker 2 (491:51:35 \- 495:52:05):** Yeah. Right. Yeah. That, that seems like a lot of companies, uh, have that kind of system. So I'm wondering that, what, what could be the reason in your company? Is it like some data trust or privacy issues that what, what could be the reason that they're preferring that way? 

**Speaker 1 (496:09:15 \- 506:12:45):** Yeah, I'd say part partly data trust. I think partly also the way the team was managed in the past. So we've had a lot of changes in the team and the, the management of the team and, um, there was quite a lot of reluctance from some of the previous managers in the team to share data. So it just meant that it all kind of sat with us. Um, it's something we're looking into at the moment, um, as a part of the new team that we're set up to have some sort of platform where people can start to self-serve and it'll hold sort of all the research that we've done previously. 

**Speaker 2 (506:48:45 \- 509:39:05):** Right. Thanks. And can you gimme just this last question, uh, that can you gimme name of uh, some of those, uh, qualitative work, quantitative tools that you often use? 

**Speaker 1 (510:15:35 \- 521:26:35):** Um, so they're all kind of dashboards that different research agencies run. So we've got, we've got a few different ones at the moment. Um, but yeah, they're all just sort of general dashboards. They're all kind of one and the same, I'd say. Um, yeah, so one of the companies we use is U Gov, for example. They've got a couple of dashboards that we sign up to. Um, the, yeah, one of the other agencies is koro. Um, so they provide a couple of different things as well. They kind of provide this sort of, uh, monthly report that we sign up to that gives sort of general consumer information. So it's all, all stuff like that. 

**Speaker 2 (521:44:25 \- 526:36:05):** Oh, very good. So yeah, that, that was mostly about the interpretation level. When you see the results in the dashboard, what were the tools that are used to analyze? Uh, I mean you can forget what the agencies, uh, what what your in-house, uh, tools, uh, what could be the name of those tools, uh, that you are using. 

**Speaker 1 (526:39:05 \- 527:30:05):** Oh, okay. So you're thinking like Tableau, stuff like that? 

**Speaker 2 (527:36:35 \- 528:32:05):** Yeah, yeah. Like, uh, yeah, for Power bi Tableau or? 

**Speaker 1 (528:35:55 \- 533:56:05):** Yeah, so we use, we use Power bi. Uh, one of the ones that we've got is actually just an Excel, um, that's got pivot table information. You just drag and drop it. Uh, that's one of the most commonly used ones that I have. Um, but yeah, I'd say the main ones are Power BI probably. 

**Speaker 2 (534:18:35 \- 544:45:25):** Okay. Very good. Thanks. And, uh, yeah, if we have to like zoom out out of your project management and research and look at the entire, uh, picture, uh, for all of your day-to-Day responsibilities. So, and if there is no technical problem, there is no funding problem. And what would be your wishlist from AI to how can AI should help you? How, how can AI help you for various steps so that uh, you can have a bit more augmented experience where you can feel that, okay, AI is really helping me to do my job quicker and uh, to getting results faster. So what would be your wishlist for various steps of the product planning? 

**Speaker 1 (545:00:25 \- 560:41:35):** Uh, so I'd say at the beginning, just to be able to find information a lot quicker. Um, in terms of background, I'd say once I got to the analysis stage, more sort of, um, automation of reports. So I have to like write and um, design a lot of reports myself. So in terms of charting, so if AI could do a lot more of the charting, I know there obviously are automation tools out there, but if there was an easy one where I could just plug in the data and it's spout the information in the best way in the best possible charts, that would be good. Um, and then I suppose part of the analysis as well, if I could give AI a data set and it could spot trends, for example, like opportunities, um, within that data, that would probably help as well. 'cause it saves me working out what they're, 

**Speaker 2 (561:05:25 \- 562:33:45):** And how, how do you work out now? Like is some, uh, writing some code or manual analysis? How 

**Speaker 1 (562:33:45 \- 565:52:25):** Do you just manual analysis. So I'll be charting the data and looking for the trends myself or looking for the interesting insights. So if AI was able to do that for me by just sending it the database for example, that would be good. 

**Speaker 2 (566:17:25 \- 570:37:35):** Alright, thanks. And sorry, just one last question. Mm-Hmm. About the type of data sets that you feed to your analysis framework. So can you gimme an example of the type of data sets you feed? You have Excel sheets, uh, what, what else? You can feed it there. 

**Speaker 1 (570:43:25 \- 573:15:35):** It's basically all Excel. Most of what I deal with is Excel. Um, so yeah, it would just be a large data sheet with all the different questions and all their different answers, all of them on Excel. 

**Speaker 2 (573:33:24 \- 576:49:34):** Okay. Right. Thanks. Thank you very much. Uh, thank, uh, yeah, that was more or less all of my questions and uh, I really enjoyed talking to you. Uh, do you have any question for me or our company? 

**Speaker 1 (577:05:34 \- 578:47:55):** Uh, no, I just suppose there was a, the mention of the, the voucher. So just how I, I claim that would be good to know. 

**Speaker 2 (578:54:54 \- 583:04:35):** Uh, right. Yeah. Thanks. So I will, uh, yeah, send it to your email, uh, the one that you used to communicate. Uh, but uh, it has to be approved by Dave who's on holiday, so it might Yeah, no worries. Few more days. Uh, but yeah, definitely I will order it right away now. 

**Speaker 1 (583:12:25 \- 583:22:35):** Okay, perfect. 

**Speaker 2 (583:27:05 \- 584:11:55):** Yeah, you will receive an Amazon voucher, uh, in your email. 

**Speaker 1 (584:18:25 \- 584:38:35):** Perfect. Thanks a lot. 

**Speaker 2 (584:43:25 \- 585:55:15):** Thank you very much, Robert. It was really nice talking to you. Have you too, rest of the day. 

**Speaker 1 (586:02:15 \- 586:31:55):** You too. Cheers. Bye. Bye.
