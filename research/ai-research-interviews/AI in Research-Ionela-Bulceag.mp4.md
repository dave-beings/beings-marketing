  
**Speaker 0 (8:25 \- 8:33:45):** Research and insights at Beings. It's a startup company. We are developing AI products for market research, and we are talking to experts like you, trying to understand that, uh, uh, we are learning more about your jobs and responsibilities and how you think you can use AI to facilitate various tasks, uh, associated with the, with your job. So please let me know a little bit more about your job and, uh, day-to-Day responsibilities, and then I can start asking more questions. 

**Speaker 1 (8:48:15 \- 23:39:45):** Sure, sure. Um, I'm a research manager, uh, within the qualitative team, um, within an international market research company based in London. Um, I've joined the company just last year. Um, so I've been involved in, um, in, in, in managing qualitative studies from like the start writing proposals all the way up to, to the end. So reporting and presentations to clients. Um, we conduct lots of, uh, interviews, focus groups. Um, we also do some more, um, innovative. We use some, some innovative methods as well, such like online communities. Um, uh, we, we use an app as well, uh, to collect data from participants. Um, and we also starting integrating AI as well, uh, in our surveys, um, to collect qualitative data, um, as well as for, uh, data analysis. 

**Speaker 0 (24:11:45 \- 27:30:15):** Great. Thank you very much for covering a lot of topics. Uh, so when you say that you're using AI in, uh, in your, uh, can, can you be a bit more, uh, can you gimme some examples? How are you using it? 

**Speaker 1 (27:53:15 \- 46:28:45):** Um, so we've started, um, so we, we work with, um, an AI company and they've developed a tool that's, uh, it's for market research. Um, and it's very, um, secure. It's, yeah, it's, um, it doesn't, um, share data like, um, externally, I guess like with other, like other US companies. So it's very secure, which is great for us. Um, so how it works is that we, uh, we add qualitative questions at the end of a survey, um, and then we, we use AI to analyze this data. So we have a platform that we share with clients as well. And, um, it shares like common themes, um, like how strong, um, those themes are coming through. Uh, and the client has access to like the, the open end, the quotes, which is yeah, great for them. And it's really, um, it's really, um, robust and it's also, um, yeah, it's quite time seeing as well, so we can, um, we can do the analysis like in, in two days maximum and we can analyze, yeah, hundreds or thousands of, um, responses. Mm-Hmm, 

**Speaker 0 (46:30:05 \- 49:30:45):** \<affirmative\> very good. Yeah. That's very interesting. And so you're using it only at the analysis time, or are you also taking help to create your service, uh, from ai? 

**Speaker 1 (50:04:25 \- 57:00:25):** Um, so we sort of like testing, um, some AI tools that could help us with that. Uh, so we have like a, um, like key people within, within the team, uh, across the company that are currently testing some AI solutions. I've tested that for a qualitative, uh, work, but, uh, I think like some people in the quantitative team have tried to play with it as well. 

**Speaker 0 (57:09:25 \- 57:39:05):** Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\> Okay, great. 

**Speaker 1 (57:43:25 \- 58:59:05):** But we haven't, uh, we haven't implemented, uh, any tool for, for that at this point. 

**Speaker 0 (59:16:25 \- 61:58:15):** Right. Thanks. And, uh, what about the qualitative side of this research? Uh, how are you using AI in that aspect? 

**Speaker 1 (62:19:05 \- 79:18:35):** Um, so as I've mentioned, like we, we are using this platform to, um, to analyze data we collect in our surveys. Um, and we use, use this for like, uh, yeah, for the, uh, qualitative, uh, questions that we add to surveys. Uh, we've also tried to, to, um, to analyze, um, a larger volume of data for, for instance, like from interviews or like from focus groups. Uh, but yeah, the platform is quite slow with that. So we've tested other solutions, but again, like we haven't implemented any within the team. I think obviously there's some concerns around like security, um, and also, um, yeah, how data is going to use to train models. Um, so yeah, we have like decided on that. And also, um, there's also, uh, the issues around like, uh, like the models, um, making like generalized statements that are not based on the data. So, uh, I'm not sure what's the industry term for that. Um, yeah, 

**Speaker 0 (79:25:15 \- 80:14:35):** I think it's, they call it like hallucinations. Hallucination, 

**Speaker 1 (80:14:35 \- 84:34:35):** Exactly. Yeah. Um, so there are some concerns about that, but obviously like we cannot share key findings or insights with clients that are not based on, on the actual data. So, um, yeah, we're trying to test a few solutions for that. 

**Speaker 0 (84:44:05 \- 92:05:55):** Right. Great. So, so, so currently you're using it, uh, for analyzing servers because you feel the information is more streamlined there and you're just trying to get meaningful insight there. But when it comes to video, uh, you don't, you can't differentiate, you can't have trust that if it's still talking about your product or if it's growing random information about from its previous knowledge. Did, did I understand correctly? 

**Speaker 1 (92:13:55 \- 109:26:35):** I think it's more about the volume of data. 'cause obviously for the surveys, we don't ask participants to write like paragraphs and paragraphs, uh, to answer those qualitative questions. So when it's a smaller volume of data, I think that platform can manage it well. But when we have like transcripts are, uh, a few pages, like 10 20 pages or the transcripts only focus groups, um, it just takes, takes it a lot longer to analyze it. And, um, yeah, it's very slow and it doesn't really help us much with that. And since you've been mentioned like videos, we also do a lot of online communities, um, and like one of the platforms that we're using is also implementing semi solutions. So we haven't, um, actually tried, um, started to using them. I think they, they're still trying to, to add it to the platform that, but that could be like another solution. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. Um, so it's going to, all the data is going to be automatic and analyzed in that platform. Um, and then, um, so yeah, but that was going to be managed by, by the platform, not by us, if that makes sense. 

**Speaker 0 (109:33:35 \- 123:16:55):** So, no. Yeah, that, that's totally sensible. When you say platforms, are you talking about the external platform that's provid you, the services and, yeah. Okay. Right, thanks. Uh, okay. So, so if, uh, yeah, I'm just trying to understand that. What are the different ways for you to, and, uh, to continue your research? One is surveys where you can take help from AI to analyze. Another one is, uh, uh, audio or video recording when you're talking to people. Yeah. And, and the third one is, uh, online communities. Right? How, so how, how would you, uh, differentiate what kind of data you collect from online communities? Uh, I mean, how does it complement the other two parts? What kind of data you collect and how do you analyze information that you're collecting from online communities? 

**Speaker 1 (123:35:15 \- 132:31:05):** So on online communities is we have like a wider range of tasks that we give participants. So, uh, we can, uh, have like polls, we can have creative tasks. We do a lot of like comms testing, uh, in online communities. Um, so it's very like visual. Uh, they can also upload different documents, audio. Um, so it's very, yeah, it's very interactive. It's very visual. So yeah, it's going to help us with like summarizing all that data that is captured, um, yeah. In, in that community. 

**Speaker 0 (132:52:15 \- 133:59:05):** Yeah, that's, yeah, that's very interesting. I, and, sorry, 

**Speaker 1 (134:00:35 \- 139:51:55):** Sorry. And the communities that are also for at least like 4, 3, 4 days. Um, so the AI is going to like, analyze Yeah. For each day. And also like, we have like different segments within that community, so it's going to give us like a more competi view of everything that's being uploaded, everything that participants say. Um, so it's going to speed up the process a lot for us. 

**Speaker 0 (140:09:15 \- 145:00:44):** Yeah. Very good. Thanks. And, uh, what would you say about, uh, the overall share of these different ways, uh, of collecting data, either survey or video recording or, um, or online communities? What is the share of these three things in market research? 

**Speaker 1 (145:41:05 \- 145:44:45):** Um, 

**Speaker 1 (146:33:35 \- 162:07:35):** Yeah, that's very difficult to say. Um, I think like the, the ai, um, added to the service is just like a new feature that we've, we've tried to like sell to clients. So I think that's something that we've done in the last few months. So it's very new. So I think like it's, that's less, less than 10% right? Of the whole project. Um, I would say like online communities have been very popular in the last year, so I think like half of the projects that I've done, I think they've been online communities and yeah, we had to do like the analysis manually. Obviously there's some features on the platform, but it's not, AI is not enabled, so we had to do everything manually. And then, uh, yeah, focus groups, interviews. Yeah, they're still very, yeah, still very popular. So maybe like 40%. Yeah. Uh, yeah, because like colon communities have been very attractive to clients in the last year, but yeah, it's quite hard to, to answer it, it really depends. 

**Speaker 0 (162:27:35 \- 163:46:35):** Oh, sorry, you're saying that it, it's hard for AI to facilitate focus researcher discussion? 

**Speaker 1 (164:14:05 \- 165:03:45):** No, sorry, were you asking like the share? Um, 

**Speaker 0 (165:20:05 \- 165:29:05):** No, sorry, yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (165:30:05 \- 165:57:05):** Of these methods or, 

**Speaker 0 (166:06:45 \- 175:25:45):** No, I wanted to understand like when we say research in market research industry, and I wanted to ask that, uh, how many percentage, uh, of the work is done through surveys? Like you said, less than 10%. That's a great answer. Then another 40 is probably focus group, and then maybe another percentage is like one-to-one interviews like we are having now. And then there is probably another share in market research industry when you rely on your data that you're collecting through online communities. Right. So I wanted to understand the different ways data is coming under this big umbrella. 

**Speaker 1 (175:43:35 \- 189:38:45):** Okay. So I'm not sure if I can generalize the market research sector. So obviously like in qualitative, in the qualitative team that I'm in, and yeah, like surveys, yeah. There very, uh, small parts like we add, we've added this feature Yeah. Just like very recently. And, um, yeah, we added to like, we work with the quantitative team, like when they implement their surveys, we add this qualitative questions to that, so it's quite new. Okay. So maybe like 10% is that, or maybe even less than that, online communities, I would say like, yeah, 40, 40% of the projects use this methods, this method, and then, uh, I think like focus group would be, um, yeah, maybe like a 30% and then the rest is just interviews. Um, so does that make sense? 

**Speaker 0 (189:45:55 \- 190:08:45):** Sure, sure, sure. Very. Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (190:13:55 \- 190:52:05):** It's a very like, rough estimate. They just, yeah. So 

**Speaker 0 (190:57:05 \- 200:09:25):** No. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I'm not looking for like concrete number, I mean, whatever is your experience, uh, particularly through your job. I was trying to understand that. What is your perception? Uh, so yeah, thank you very much for that. And, uh, about online communities, uh, uh, is your current company running those online communities or you rely on some other existing, uh, online communities and you go there and you ask questions or, you know, try to get feedback from, uh, people who are not directly part of your company? How does it work? Who's the owner of those online community websites? 

**Speaker 1 (200:27:45 \- 205:52:05):** Uh, so yeah, we work like with a third party and we have an, uh, a, um, a license for that. So we work with them, but like the participants are recruited from like our panel, um, and then like we interact with them, so they just provide the platform and that's it. Like they don't really inter interfere with the community at all. 

**Speaker 0 (206:05:25 \- 210:16:35):** Great. Thanks. And can, can you, is it possible for you to tell me the names of, uh, some tools or platforms that are providing you participant provid for focus group, provid and for service and for online communities? I believe they're probably different one. 

**Speaker 1 (210:28:15 \- 211:46:05):** So like we have our own, my company has their own panel of participants. 

**Speaker 0 (211:57:55 \- 212:08:05):** Okay. So 

**Speaker 1 (212:08:05 \- 213:12:45):** These are recruited from our panel. So this our, our own participants. 

**Speaker 0 (213:27:05 \- 217:15:35):** Well, even, even through online communities, even if it's a third party? Yes. Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks. And, uh, uh, what, what is the incentive for them? Why do they want to participate in different kind of research? 

**Speaker 1 (217:40:35 \- 228:00:55):** Um, I mean, obviously like we, we give them a voucher for any activity that they take part in. Um, and then obviously like we, we work on like a lot of like important issues. Like we produce a lot of like p public sector. So yeah, I've seen like, are very interested to give their opinion on like, current issues. Um, like the projects are super interesting, so they seem very engaged, like throughout. Uh, so I think like, just like the nature of the projects, the nature of, uh, the research that they're doing is very interesting to them and obviously like we try to maintain that relationship with, with them. Uh, and yeah, we try to keep them engaged. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. 

**Speaker 0 (228:18:15 \- 231:28:05):** Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks. And, uh, would it be possible for you to tell me the name of the AI tools that, uh, you have, uh, that you have been using or the platform? 

**Speaker 1 (231:54:35 \- 234:57:45):** Um, yeah, I'm not sure if I can give you that. Like, one of them is obviously like, yeah, it's the feature that we use, like we're trying like to sell it to clients as well. So I'm not sure if I can Yeah. Give it the name. 

**Speaker 0 (235:06:55 \- 236:17:45):** Okay. Yeah, no, sure. Yeah, we can, we can, uh, we can ignore the 

**Speaker 1 (236:17:45 \- 246:07:45):** Name. I mean, we, I can give you some of like the general ones that like we've tested, like we haven't implemented for instance, right? Like, uh, we've looked at like Microsoft, uh, copilot for instance. We've used, we tried to like use, I try to look at your GPT if Yeah. Secure, we can, yeah. Implement it. Obviously that that's not an option. We try to, like yabo for instance. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>, uh, um, uh, uh, which one, um, clouds as well for analysis. So yeah, just we've, we try to look at like a wide range of options 

**Speaker 0 (246:28:45 \- 250:29:25):** And, uh, no, that, that, that's, I think even better than the names of one you're using. So why didn't you, uh, why didn't you go for move forward with the either of, uh, these four options that you mentioned? Were there like some obvious concerns? 

**Speaker 1 (250:37:55 \- 264:56:05):** Yeah, I think our data security is like an, um, a really big concern for us. We, like, we want to keep, uh, the data of our participants secure and we don't want to, to share that, or we don't want them to use the, the data to train their models. I mean, that's very important for us. It's important for the clients. Uh, so that's like a massive concern. Uh, there's some instances like where we didn't find the AI to be very effective and analyzing like a huge volume of data, so that was like another concern. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> and I, as I've mentioned, like, um, hallucination and making like very general statements, uh, they're not based in the data and like we have no, um, guarantee that, um, like the, the, the insights that we're sharing with clients or like the findings that we're sharing are actually based on, on the data. 

**Speaker 0 (265:11:35 \- 265:32:45):** Right. Thanks. Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (265:45:55 \- 265:50:45):** Yeah, 

**Speaker 0 (266:10:55 \- 273:30:25):** Yeah. Great. Thanks. And now about the tool that you have been using or integrated, I'm not asking the name. You can ignore the name. Can you highlight, uh, the type of, uh, work it's, uh, doing for you? What are the main target, uh, like for qualitative research? Are you using it mostly for transcription or thematic analysis or sentiments? So can you gimme these kind of example where the AI tool is actually helping you? 

**Speaker 1 (273:45:35 \- 281:51:55):** Yeah, so it's, uh, the tool that I mentioned that we are adding to our surveys. Uh, so yeah, it's doing thematic analysis, I think like sentiment analysis as well. Um, so it has like a dashboard where you can yeah, see the strength of that like sentiment and like the clients can see that as well and all, there's also an option to chat with the, uh, AI function. Um, and like the clients can do this, sorry, the clients can do this themselves and they can ask questions and interrogate the data further. 

**Speaker 0 (282:02:55 \- 288:37:15):** Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. Right. Thanks. And for, for sentiment analysis, visualization, is it just giving you like a, uh, that okay, 60% positive or 30% negative, 10% neutral. Is, is it giving you like a pie chart like this or it's a bit more serious, uh, also throwing you a word cloud or telling more about, uh, more specific about the meeting that what was positive or what was negative? 

**Speaker 1 (288:49:45 \- 295:56:55):** Yeah, I think it can be more specific than that. Um, like yeah, there's, there are this general statement that it makes, uh, but then you can, yeah, like there's a chart and you can click on it and see like in more depth what the data is saying. You can also like add it, um, those categories, uh, and you can yeah, adjust it through the research, like the know Yeah. Based on the knowledge that you already have, so you can play with it a bit more. 

**Speaker 0 (296:26:55 \- 297:32:05):** Yeah. Very good. Yeah. Thanks. Very interesting. And, uh, and 

**Speaker 1 (297:32:05 \- 299:00:45):** I do think it has a workload as well. Uh, I haven't used it, but yeah, I, I remember seeing this function. Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (299:15:55 \- 305:50:55):** Okay. Great. And, uh, for like, if you want to do some kind of coding and tagging at the end, uh, with, to, to understand, uh, uh, something more to not just finding meeting summary or key insight, but, uh, running the coding and tagging analysis based on some few words, can you still play with that and, uh, run that? 

**Speaker 1 (305:54:35 \- 311:57:45):** Um, no, I don't think, I don't think you can do tagging with this. Um, I think you can go in more depth and explore the categories or the subcategories, and then it going to link the, the actual transcript, so you can see on like, on the right side, like the actual transcript and the quotes. Um, but I don't think like you can Yeah. Tag, tag it yourself or 

**Speaker 0 (312:14:25 \- 312:27:35):** Right. Thanks. 

**Speaker 1 (312:28:05 \- 313:24:15):** Yeah. But like you can chat with the ai for instance, 

**Speaker 0 (313:52:15 \- 319:13:25):** You can chat, you can ask questions. Yeah. And it'll still give you more or less similar answer of, uh, about the initial information that it has given to you, right? Like meeting summary, key insight and sentiment analysis, or can you get something more, can you get some kind of recommendation or the list 

**Speaker 1 (319:13:45 \- 321:01:25):** Of Yeah, you can, yeah, you can, it usually gives recommendations and like key actions and yeah. Suggestions as well. Yeah, you can, you can. 

**Speaker 0 (321:13:55 \- 332:11:15):** Right. Thanks. And can you give me, uh, one example of like whole product? Like if we zoom out from transcription and we look at the bigger picture, let's say you are planning a search project, like qualitative research project. Uh, what would be the ideal journey of this project? Starting from project planning to finding participant, then data coding and then data analysis, and then at the end, sharing those result with somebody. So what are the tools that you use at various steps? And, uh, what is the average time that you have to spend? If you can just give an example of something, um, from product planning to 

**Speaker 1 (332:18:45 \- 332:49:55):** Where you use AI or some, 

**Speaker 0 (333:02:35 \- 336:58:45):** Uh, well, you can give dramatic example, then you can also tell that, okay, here AI had helped, or here AI could have helped. Yeah. And in whatever way you feel. Okay. Or you can give two different example, one with ai, one with non-AI. 

**Speaker 1 (337:19:45 \- 354:14:05):** Um, so we start with like writing the proposal, uh, for the client, either like in Word or PowerPoints obviously, like using AI for this could help or having like an AI tool to perhaps, um, propose like a discussion guide for a project in doubt that could be useful. I think this is like done by the researchers at the moment based on like previous experience, like previous projects. So like once we, um, we, in that project, we, we start like with the recruitment, and obviously as I've mentioned, like we have our panel, so like we recruit participants based on like a screener, which is like a short survey, um, ensuring that they meet all the characteristics that we need, and then we yeah, start designing the research tools. Um, yeah, this is, is just done in board and I, as I've said, I could, if, uh, we had AI to perhaps provide suggestions or, um, explore or like have a look at all the previous, um, documents previous, like research shows that we use, I think that could be useful. 

**Speaker 1 (354:26:25 \- 369:36:35):** Um, so yeah, once like those are, um, developed, like we, we have the, the client, uh, signing them off. Uh, we start field work. We are the con like conduct interviews, focus groups or the communities for the participants. Uh, and this, these are done, yeah. On different platforms, as I mentioned for the online communities. We have, um, um, a third party that we are using. Same for like text-based focus groups. We have a third, third party that's providing that for interviews. We just do it on yeah. Zoom teams. So yeah, there's no need for AI there. And then, um, yeah, we move into analysis, uh, here. Yeah, it's usually done, um, on, on the platform. So like on the online community, they do have some function for the analysis, but it still still has to be done manually. Um, they're trying to implement some AI features, which, yeah, again, I, if they could do that, that would be great. 

**Speaker 1 (369:50:55 \- 385:32:45):** Uh, but, uh, for, for others, like, for the focus groups, for the interviews, this are just done manually by, by the research team. Um, and yeah, we, as I've mentioned, we try to test a few AI tools, but like, we haven't implemented any at this point. Um, I think like this could be like, uh, a major area where AI could be really useful. Slice, scan everything and provide suggestions, provide recommendations to clients based on the data. Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. And then we move into reporting, which is done either in in words or in, you know, PowerPoint. And again here, uh, if AI can, yeah, select those key insights from the analysis and then move it into different reporting template. I think that could be like an area which would be great to have support. I think like, um, we tested Microsoft Co-pilot for this, but it's just not advanced enough to, uh, to do that for us. And then at the end, we just present it to, to the clients. So this, does this help or 

**Speaker 0 (385:43:45 \- 390:36:05):** No? Yeah. Very helpful. Thank you very much for, for very elaborate answer. And when you mentioned that, uh, for online meetings, you're using either Zoom or Teams, and there is no need for AI there. So how do you record that information and then how do you feed it back to your AI tool? 

**Speaker 1 (390:58:45 \- 397:32:05):** Um, actually for, uh, we do have, um, so Zoom has a feature with AI transcripts, so yeah, that's, that's a good point. So we do have the AI transcripts from Zoom, um, and then we, the researchers analyze that. Those, they're not perfect. Uh, they still have some errors, but yeah, they're still, yeah, they're free or anything, like, they're a lot cheaper compared to professional transcripts. So yeah, we do use that. 

**Speaker 0 (397:45:45 \- 399:11:25):** And what about teams and how do you record that or bring back to your AI model? Uh, sorry, your AI tool. 

**Speaker 1 (399:28:25 \- 401:38:05):** Uh, teams, I think like the team also up uploads teams, interviews as well to Zoom and then receive the transcripts, I think. 

**Speaker 0 (401:56:05 \- 402:09:35):** Okay. I 

**Speaker 1 (402:09:35 \- 403:32:55):** Think sometimes we use like professional transcripts if we have to share them with clients. 

**Speaker 0 (403:53:45 \- 404:52:45):** So the professional transcript means like, uh, some human you hire 

**Speaker 1 (404:54:35 \- 405:37:25):** Yeah, yeah. A different agency. Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (405:43:35 \- 407:53:25):** Right. I thought that it's like, uh, some online transcription tool that you invite to meetings and that will automatically record transcript. 

**Speaker 1 (408:08:35 \- 412:10:45):** Yeah. I think like some parts of the company use that as well. Uh, we thought, yeah, we, we use Zoom transcripts, which are okay enough for us. Yeah. Uh, then there's, we still have like some errors here and there, but it's, yeah, it's enough for the analysis. 

**Speaker 0 (412:26:05 \- 420:33:55):** Right. Great. Thanks. And, uh, so like you started with the words like, sorry, no words means that, uh, either Google's, uh, Google Docs or Microsoft Word that you use for product planning. So sometime you go to chat DPT to ask for suggestion for product planning. Right. And then you have more than one type of, uh, sources that can provide you participant, I'm just trying to summarize if I understood correctly and, uh, 

**Speaker 1 (420:45:35 \- 424:01:05):** No, uh, project planning. Yeah, I think that's still done by researchers, like on Excel, uh, on words. It's 

**Speaker 0 (424:01:05 \- 424:09:45):** Totally manually, 

**Speaker 1 (424:20:35 \- 424:26:25):** Sorry, 

**Speaker 0 (424:32:15 \- 425:11:05):** It's totally manual still project planning. 

**Speaker 1 (425:37:55 \- 426:22:45):** Yeah. Like we, that's done with the client, so it's, um, 

**Speaker 0 (426:41:55 \- 426:46:45):** Sure, 

**Speaker 1 (426:46:45 \- 430:15:05):** Sure. It depends on, yeah, it very much depends on the project. So we do have like a, we have step by step, um, yeah. Plan that we use for, for projects. So, but that's like an excel, like a gone chart. Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (430:26:55 \- 436:37:05):** Yeah. Right. Thanks. And, uh, in your qualitative, uh, in, in any given project where you are mostly conducting qualitative research, do you have to actively collaborate with quantitative researchers and, uh, how much information you share with them? Or what part of, uh, the work in a given project is played by quantitative researcher? 

**Speaker 1 (437:02:05 \- 446:50:45):** Um, it's very much depends on, on the client and the project. So some projects are mixed. They use a mixed, um, methodology. Um, yeah, so that, like, usually like the, the surveys come first, uh, and then like we do like an in-depth exploration for qualitative research, or we try to do some initial exploration and we do some interviews or some focus groups, uh, and then the quantitative time, the quantitative team takes over and then they, um, implement the survey with like, uh, yeah. Mm-Hmm. Thousands of people. It, it very much depends Yeah. On the project. 

**Speaker 0 (447:01:55 \- 459:26:45):** Yeah. Right. Thanks. And, uh, if there is no problem with the technology or funding, uh, and, and you have to give your wishlist, so from product planning to the end result of PowerPoint presentation, you mentioned few plus points that very AI could help, but if you have to design like, uh, your own AI tool that could help you, not just with the research and analysis, but also for the project planning, since you're a manager now. So you also talk, uh, with the, a lot of other people, different kind of stakeholder. So research plus management, if you have to look at the bigger picture. And, uh, tell me your wishlist. What do you expect from ai? Uh, where do you think AI could help you, uh, across this whole journey? 

**Speaker 1 (459:51:55 \- 479:40:35):** Yeah, that's a good, that's a good question. I think like, uh, everything starts like from the proposal writing. So, um, it can, I think like AI could be used to maybe like identify, uh, like, uh, the proposal that have been won, uh, and perhaps like you can write like, I need this, I need this type of methods for this project. Um, what are some of like the, uh, examples from like the, the winning proposals that we used and like, can you adapt it to this, this project? And you can give it maybe like the background, the context with the client is what they're looking for. Uh, I think, yeah, that could be like a, a great addition. Um, I think like, um, yeah, idea. I, I think that would be like, uh, the project writing, uh, also like the analysis probably like the, the biggest area where like we would need AI to, to, to support with that. So really like summarizing all the data. Um, 'cause I think like that we take a lot, a lot of time to, yeah. To go through to everything. Uh, and then like write the reports. I think like that area could definitely be done more effectively using ai. 

**Speaker 0 (480:24:55 \- 492:08:25):** Yeah. Right. Thanks. Yeah, that's brilliant. And at the end, when you're sharing information, uh, on average, what are the expertise of different stakeholders whom, uh, you have to share this result at the end? So you might have clients, you might have, uh, people higher up in the management, uh, roles in your team, and probably other researcher as well. So how do you, uh, communicate the same product with a different kind of audience that, do you have to prepare a separate presentation for all of them or do you have all this information shared somewhere on the cloud that you just share the link and, uh, anybody can see it? So how do you share the information at the end? 

**Speaker 1 (492:38:35 \- 512:29:35):** So we don't really share a lot of the information internally, unless it's some best practices, um, that we share with the whole team or like other teams. Uh, so it's not really done internally, like all the insights are shared externally. So for instance, like public sector, uh, yeah, we work with like, um, the director of that particular department within like, yeah, within the government. So yeah, really high up stakeholders. Um, and then this, the reports have to be like very formal. They're, uh, they're usually done in board, so just like very long, uh, very like professional. And then like on the commercial side, uh, like we work with lot like companies, like within different sectors, so it has to be adapted to their, that particular needs. Uh, we used to, we need to use like the terminology that they use. Uh, they have to be more action orientated, more insightful. Like for instance, like the short sentences have to be shorter, more Yeah, just sharper in general. Um, yeah, it's very much depends on the client. Like we can be dealing with someone in their research team or their marketing team or, yeah, it varies I guess. 

**Speaker 0 (512:51:25 \- 519:42:15):** Very good. Yeah. Thank you very much. So just last question now about the potential concerns. Do you see any potential concern like ethical or technological or any other concern that you feel like, uh, you're happy to go towards any new tool available in the market that can make my life easier or, but there is this potential concern that I'm really worried about? Uh, can you think of something like that, that could really hold you away? 

**Speaker 1 (520:46:25 \- 528:12:35):** Um, I mean, we also do a lot of like, um, sensitive research, really like children, young people. So I wouldn't want AI to be involved in that. Um, I'd like conducting the analysis or, um, being too, too involved in the analysis perhaps. So it's, I would have concerns of of yeah, maybe about that. 

**Speaker 0 (529:00:35 \- 529:51:25):** So does, does. Sorry. 

**Speaker 1 (529:55:15 \- 537:33:05):** Yeah, I'm not really, I don't think I have, yeah. Any concerns because like on the recruitment side, we have the systems in place, I think like these are working like really great. So I don't see AI like stepping in there. Um, mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\> and beside that, um, it's just, yeah, analysis, reporting, I think as just as long as the data is not shared externally and, um, we have some guarantees around security, I think that's fine. I don't really have any other concerns, so. Yes. 

**Speaker 0 (537:47:15 \- 543:18:55):** Right. Thanks. Sorry, just to clarify, when you said that, uh, sensitive data and working with children, so data related to children, uh, so is the main issue behind that still the data security that since this is very sensitive and AI could, uh, may not have control of that data security. That's the only reason? 

**Speaker 1 (543:49:05 \- 543:59:15):** Yeah, I think 

**Speaker 0 (544:08:25 \- 544:39:25):** That's, or or did you need something? 

**Speaker 1 (545:04:25 \- 545:08:05):** Um, 

**Speaker 0 (545:41:55 \- 546:01:15):** I understand your concern. 

**Speaker 1 (546:06:25 \- 549:06:05):** Yeah. We, we also are discussing about like AI potentially like conducting the, the focus groups or like the interviews in the future. So I'll definitely have concerns about, um, 

**Speaker 0 (549:30:05 \- 549:46:25):** Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (549:54:45 \- 552:58:15):** And AI tool, like yeah, for instance, we do text-based focus groups. I would have concerns if AI would be Yeah. Uh, speaking with children, for instance, in, in that focus group. 

**Speaker 0 (553:17:25 \- 558:05:05):** Oh yeah, I totally agree. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for clarifying. Um, okay. Yeah, that was, uh, mostly, uh, those are mostly all of my questions. Thank you very much for your time. I really enjoyed talking to you. Do you have any question for me or our company? 

**Speaker 1 (558:40:45 \- 560:55:45):** Um, so can you share about the objectives of, of this research and then how it's going to be, how you're going to share the insights or, 

**Speaker 0 (561:19:05 \- 570:50:05):** Uh, yeah. The, uh, since we are developing the AI driven products for market research, and currently we are focusing on qualitative research area, we have developed our own video recording tool as well. Uh, and our own transcription services, which is ida, you can invite it into meetings and it can give you transcript, key insight, a meeting summary action item, and like you can talk to, uh, ai, uh, helper of the, uh, the tools that you're already using here. You can also talk to ida. So currently we, is it 

**Speaker 1 (570:59:54 \- 571:32:05):** Like, like gong something? 

**Speaker 0 (571:52:55 \- 572:14:45):** Sorry, what, what is gong? 

**Speaker 1 (572:25:55 \- 575:57:35):** It's like a software we're using as well. I mean, not our team, but like other teams are using to Yeah. Do exactly the same thing. Like it's invited in meetings and then it provides like a summary, um, key action points. 

**Speaker 0 (576:14:05 \- 576:26:15):** Yeah, yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (576:27:35 \- 576:44:55):** Something like that. Yeah. 

**Speaker 0 (576:50:05 \- 591:50:15):** Yeah. But, uh, but, but this is like just one product out of our whole business idea. So we are basically trying to provide end-to-end analysis, uh, that you can have product planning, uh, on, on our website. You can ask, uh, questions to AI that, uh, this stuff that you're doing on, in your World document or on Google Docs, you can do it on a website. And, uh, our IDA tool, the AI assistant will help you to, you don't have to copy paste the stuff to chat d to your Gemini. You can get AI assistance, uh, right in the platform. Uh, we will provide, uh, uh, ways to connect with a different participant through like prolific or respondent or acne or any other tools available in the market that can give you a link to connect to different kind of audience. Mm-Hmm. \<affirmative\>. And then if you're using Zoom team or Google Meet, you can invite IDA to their meetings or you can use our own video recording tool. 

**Speaker 0 (592:00:35 \- 612:01:25):** Uh, and uh, then you can also use our tool for product launch as well, because it provide a continu, uh, simultaneous streaming on different social media platform as well. Uh, and once you have data, uh, it'll, uh, give you the possibility to talk to it, uh, to get sentiment analysis. Uh, we are planning to launch this product in, uh, in next couple of months, or most probably in September. So the whole, uh, idea of this discussion is that trying to understand from experts like you that, uh, what are your main, uh, way of working, how do you collect different kind of data? How do you work and, uh, what are the main pain points and, uh, are we going to solve, uh, those issues, uh, through our tool or not? Mm-Hmm, \<affirmative\>. So basically we are trying to understand if we can use your insights in the, uh, in defining our product roadmap. So this whole information, it'll be strictly, you know, used by me and, uh, other product manager and, uh, member of our, of our team internally. Uh, it'll not be shared publicly, it'll not be used for any kind of data training. 

**Speaker 1 (612:11:15 \- 612:39:15):** Okay. Sounds good. 

**Speaker 0 (612:59:05 \- 617:49:15):** Okay, great. And, uh, yeah, thanks a lot. And, uh, I will, uh, share the Amazon voucher on your email. Uh, it might take around eight to 10 days because, uh, yeah, our CEO is a holiday and once he's back, yeah. So yeah, uh, that's all. 

**Speaker 1 (617:59:45 \- 618:39:15):** Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, it's very interesting interview. 

**Speaker 0 (618:57:45 \- 619:50:15):** Thank you very much Jan, the rest of the day. 

**Speaker 1 (619:53:15 \- 620:14:15):** Thanks, you too. Bye-Bye 

**Speaker 0 (620:17:25 \- 620:25:35):** Bye-Bye.
