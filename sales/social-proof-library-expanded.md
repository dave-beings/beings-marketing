#### **Iga Pilewska** - Sr Principal Research @ Gartner
> "AI is most helpful as a sparring partner and second opinion, but not yet reliable enough for full reliance. Trust and authenticity are key concerns in AI adoption."

> "In an ideal world, a contextualized AI assistant tailored to the specific research project that can understand commands in natural language and provide trustworthy information from the project's dataset."

#### **Research Professional** - Brandwatch
> "Two main uses: summarization and review of large datasets (quantitative) and getting a second opinion or testing hypotheses (qualitative)."

### **⚡ Efficiency & Time Savings**

#### **Ben** - Senior Research Manager, Quadrangle
> "Allowed solo delivery of 35+ consultation synthesis during peak Christmas period... prevented need for additional team members during busy season."

> "I'll buy your hand off for that" *(Response to £250/month pricing for efficiency gains)*

#### **Iga Pilewska** - Gartner
> "Getting insights automatically that you can compare to your own ideas of what are the key takeaways for interviews rather than rereading the transcripts and notes... That is definitely the lowest hanging fruit."

> "Some form of centralizing the data and insights from the projects as it develops, so you lose less time on the back and forth between stakeholders."

### **🎯 Professional Development & Skills**

#### **Ben** - Senior Research Manager, Quadrangle
> "It's probably the most strategic presentation I've done for quite some time."

> "Quality equivalent to 4-5 years research experience level... positioned as 'co-intelligent' tool - handles operational/tactical, humans focus on strategy."

#### **Research Professional** - From Qualitative Study
> "AI helping them here, it's all about creating and automating first drafts, and acting like the junior researcher, who would kind of take away that kind of manual workload at start, get them off that blank page."

> "Delegating those more mundane tasks, again, coming back to just allowing researchers to focus on the parts of the work that they enjoy the most and where they feel they can add the most value."

### **🔒 Security & Compliance**

#### **Iga Pilewska** - Gartner
> "The privacy of data is definitely one... I think you never know how the data will be used when you use an AI tool... there are consequences of even being fired if you misuse an AI tool that is outside of your work environment."
