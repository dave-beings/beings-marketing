## Featured Customer Testimonials

### **Iga Pilewska** - Sr Principal Research @ Gartner

#### **On Low-Hanging Fruit Automation:**
> "Getting insights automatically that you can compare to your own ideas of what are the key takeaways for interviews rather than rereading the transcripts and notes... That is definitely the lowest hanging fruit."

#### **On Project Management:**
> "Some form of centralizing the data and insights from the projects as it develops, so you lose less time on the back and forth between stakeholders... Having automatic key takeaways from each one-to-one, and then resurfacing them in the group so people can see what is happening."

#### **On AI as Research Enhancement:**
