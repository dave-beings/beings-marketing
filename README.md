## üß† Marketing OS Concept

### Core Principles
- **Logical Organization:** Knowledge flows from foundational elements (brand, research) through strategic planning to tactical execution
- **Single Source of Truth:** All marketing knowledge centrally managed in version-controlled files
- **AI-Powered:** Content generation using structured prompts with brand context and research insights
- **Brand Consistency:** Every piece references foundation files for consistent voice and messaging
- **Scalable Workflow:** Clear separation between strategy, execution, and enablement materials

### Knowledge Architecture
- **`brand/`** - Core brand identity that informs all other work
- **`research/`** - Customer insights and market intelligence that drives strategy
- **`strategy/`** - High-level planning and content calendars
- **`content/`** - All external-facing assets and materials
- **`sales/`** - Sales enablement materials and playbooks
- **`archive/`** - Historical versions and past iterations

## üéØ Q3 Brochure Project (Live Example)

The `q3-brochure-project/` demonstrates the system in action:

### Source Content (12 Files)
- **01** - Introduction to Aida in Beings
- **03** - Setting Up Your First Research Project  
- **04** - Common Onboarding Mistakes
- **05** - When to Use Aida vs. Your Own Judgment
- **06-08** - Prompting guides (synthesis candidates)
- **11-12** - Data synthesis and output creation
- **16** - Manager's guide
- **17** - Essential prompt library
- **19** - Troubleshooting

### AI-Powered Content Synthesis
Use prompts like:
```
"Using @Provisional_Brand_Voice_Guide.md and @Q3_Brochure_Project.md, 
synthesize content from @source-drafts/06-how-to-write-effective-aida-prompts.md, 
@source-drafts/07-prompting-aida-for-deeper-research-insights.md, and 
@source-drafts/08-debugging-and-iterating-aida-prompts.md into a single, 
concise 'Ultimate Prompting Guide' section for our brochure..."
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+

- Version control all changes
- Iterate based on feedback

## üé® Brand Voice

**Core Tone:** Insightful, Direct, Empowering  
**Style:** Seth Godin-inspired - concise, story-led, impactful  
**Gut Check:** "Does this make our researcher feel smarter and more capable?"

See `content/Provisional_Brand_Voice_Guide.md` for complete guidelines.

## üîÑ Continuous Integration
