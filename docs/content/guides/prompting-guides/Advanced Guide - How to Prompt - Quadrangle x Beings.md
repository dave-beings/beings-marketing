__A Multi\-Layered Approach to Emotion, Narrative, and Messaging__

### <a id="_pgs1me8e7aie"></a>__🎯 Objective__

This guide outlines a structured, two\-phase workflow for analysing 28 qualitative interview transcripts for the Benenden Health proposition project\. By combining core data extraction with advanced qualitative methods—__sentiment analysis, narrative deconstruction, and discourse mapping__—this framework enables deep, strategic insight generation aligned to key brand and messaging objectives\.

## <a id="_8w4qcs924010"></a>__🧩 Workflow Overview__

To preserve accuracy, context, and interpretability, we split the analysis into two focused phases:

1. __Phase 1: Structured Insight Capture  
__ – Each transcript is analysed individually using a three\-part method\.  

2. __Phase 2: Thematic Synthesis & Brand Strategy  
__ – The summaries are then analysed as a set to extract patterns, messaging implications, and creative recommendations\.  


## <a id="_594sfd1aaqbw"></a>__📘 Phase 1: Structured Insight Capture \(1:1 Transcript Analysis\)__

For each transcript, apply the following three prompts in sequence\. This will generate a rich, layered output per participant that blends emotional signals, factual context, and storytelling moments\.

### <a id="_60bulcfad5cm"></a>__🔹 Prompt 1\.1 – Emotion & Sentiment Mapping__

“Act as an emotion analyst\. For transcript \[filename\], identify the __core emotion__ \(e\.g\., Frustration, Relief, Trust, Loyalty, Cynicism\) expressed when the participant discusses:  
 • Their interactions with Benenden staff  
 • The referral and treatment process  
 • The ‘not\-for\-profit’ nature of Benenden

For each topic, include the dominant emotion and the direct quote that supports it\.”

### <a id="_3ag54l70a2c0"></a>__🔹 Prompt 1\.2 – Core Profile & Understanding__

“Summarise the participant’s experience and context\. Include:  
 • Their relationship with Benenden \(membership length, how they joined\)  
 • Overall sentiment \(including an ‘Ambassador Score’: Low / Medium / High\)  
 • Primary reason for staying with Benenden \(even if alternatives exist\)  
 • Core healthcare values \(e\.g\., fairness, responsiveness, personal care\)  
 • Any services they misunderstood or were unaware of  
 • Their reaction to each proposition territory and strapline”

### <a id="_ffktt9d8kd95"></a>__🔹 Prompt 1\.3 – Narrative Deconstruction: 'Moment of Truth'__

“Identify the most detailed story the participant tells about an experience with Benenden\. Break it down into:  
 • __Goal__ – What they were trying to achieve  
 • __Conflict__ – What went wrong, confused, or frustrated them  
 • __Resolution__ – How the situation was handled or concluded  
 • __Takeaway__ – What Benenden should learn from this story”

## <a id="_5obdyg2z38"></a>__🔍 Phase 2: Thematic Synthesis & Brand Strategy__

With 28 rich summaries in hand, synthesise them across four critical areas:

### <a id="_g08yqeff07wj"></a>__🔹 Prompt 2\.1 – Proposition Resonance__

“Which proposition territory—__Caring/Emotive__ or __Value/Affordability__—was most compelling overall?  
 Provide:  
 • The preferred route  
 • Top 3 reasons it resonated  
 • Supporting quotes or paraphrased examples”

### <a id="_fhw0r8axstw3"></a>__🔹 Prompt 2\.2 – Discourse Mapping: Brand vs Competitors__

“analyse the language used to describe Benenden vs\. competitors \(e\.g\., Bupa, Vitality\)\.  
 • What metaphors, adjectives, and tone are associated with Benenden \(e\.g\., 'union', 'human', 'trusted'\)?  
 • What language describes competitors \(e\.g\., 'cold', 'transactional', 'corporate'\)?  
 Summarise Benenden’s __discursive identity__—the set of terms and ideas that create its perceived difference\.”

### <a id="_eqq6ek4fvhtg"></a>__🔹 Prompt 2\.3 – Messaging ‘Golden Nuggets’__

“What are the __top 3–5 Reasons to Believe \(RTBs\)__ that consistently emerged?  
 Rank them by emotional weight and frequency of mention\. Provide representative quotes\. Focus on:  
 • Inclusion of pre\-existing conditions  
 • ‘Health union’ or not\-for\-profit model  
 • Wait\-time policy \(vs\. member perception\)”

### <a id="_rnumh8xl1ma0"></a>__🔹 Prompt 2\.4 – Creative Brief & Communication Plan__

“Based on the full dataset, build a strategic messaging framework for Benenden’s next campaign:  
 • __Headline Promise__ – What core message must lead?  
 • __Proof Points__ – 2–3 features to validate the claim  
 • __Brand Story & Tone__ – How to express ‘not\-for\-profit’ without cynicism\. What tone \(e\.g\., warm, direct, professional\) works best?  
 • __Do Not Use List__ – Words, phrases, or straplines that failed with participants \(e\.g\., ‘Healthcare done different’\)”
