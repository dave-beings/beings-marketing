# **Introduction to Aida in Beings**

If you work in research, you’ll be familiar with the exhausting amount of time it takes to get things done: hours of interviews followed by days of transcription, coding the qualitative research, and sorting through notes. Insights take a while to unearth because the entire process is slowed to a crawl by admin work.

That’s where **Aida**, the AI engine inside Beings, comes in. Unlike generic chatbots or GPT wrappers, **Aida is custom-built for qualitative research**. It understands the flow of studies, the weight of transcripts, and the difference between a passing comment and a recurring theme.

Most importantly, Aida isn’t here to replace you. It removes bottlenecks so you can focus on what really matters: your judgment, your analysis, and your ability to tell the story behind the data.

## **What Aida Is (and Isn’t)**

At its core, Aida is a tool for enhancing qualitative research workflows by automating the admin work. It **transcribes interviews**, **codes responses**, **clusters themes**, **generates summaries**, and **drafts first reports**. This kind of work might take days if you did it by yourself, but with Aida, you can get results in a flash.

Crucially though, Aida doesn’t decide which insights matter. It doesn’t interpret cultural nuance or make recommendations either. Those choices remain firmly in your hands.

This balance is deliberate. Aida takes care of repetitive tasks so you can spend time analysing and interpreting. **For managers, this provides clear value:** teams spend less time on admin, deliver faster, and scale work without burning out.

## **Why Aida Matters for Researchers**

Aida speeds up the monotonous work that needs to be done to access the insights, automating tedious tasks so researchers can dive straight into what they do best.

By automating transcription, coding, and first-pass theming, Aida delivers structured material in hours instead of days. You can spend time spotting patterns and nuances rather than battling the backlog.

Imagine you’ve just finished 10 in-depth interviews for a client. Traditionally, you’d wait days for transcripts, then hand-code every line. With Aida, transcripts and suggested themes appear within minutes. You immediately see which topics are resonating, where participants diverge, and which quotes tell the story.

Additionally, it maintains a consistent format across your entire organisation. Where each individual researcher might have a slightly different way of coding topics, Aida brings in a unified system that can still be adjusted for personal tastes.

The benefits compound across projects. You get a quicker turnaround, consistent outputs across teams, and the ability to scale without stretching resources. For researchers, Aida means less fatigue and more focus. For managers, it means predictable quality and faster delivery of client-ready insights.

## **How Aida Supports (But Doesn’t Replace) Human Judgment**

Aida works best as a first pass. **It suggests while you review and interpret.** In essence, it takes over the dull side of research, empowering you to focus on the exciting part: actually connecting the dots and preparing the user story.

For example, upload focus group transcripts and Aida may highlight themes like “price sensitivity” and “ease of use.” You decide which themes matter most for the client brief, and how to frame the narrative.

Concerned about bias? Every code, theme, or summary is linked back to the transcript. You can see, adjust, or discard suggestions at any point.

**For managers, the payoff is reliability and reduced risk of missed insights.** Aida applies consistent logic across projects, while researchers remain in control of interpretation and strategy.

## **Real Uses in Agency Life**

Let’s take a look at a few everyday use cases for researchers:

**1\. UX team – faster usability reports**  
After a round of usability tests, you upload recordings into Beings. Aida delivers transcripts, suggests codes like “navigation issues” and “checkout delays,” and provides a summary of common pain points. Instead of losing a week, the team shares a polished report by the end of the day.   
**ROI:** Faster cycles mean more testing within the same budget.

**2\. Market research agency – scaling focus groups**  
An agency runs 50 focus groups across different regions. They make the smart decision to upload their sessions to Aida rather than trying to manually code it all. It auto-transcribes, applies consistent codes, and clusters cross-group themes such as “brand loyalty” or “value for money.” Researchers then refine outputs.   
**ROI:** Weeks of effort reduced to days, freeing staff for deeper analysis.

**3\. Internal insights team – exec dashboards**  
A corporate insights team uploads interviews and surveys into Aida, then uses Beings’ insights hub to build shareable dashboards. Executives see live themes, supported by verbatim quotes, with every insight traceable back to source.   
**ROI:** Leaders get clarity and confidence, while insights teams show direct strategic impact.

## **Getting Started with Aida**

You can get set up with Aida in just a couple of minutes. Simply create an account (if you haven’t already), log in, and then generate a study. If you already have recordings from usability sessions, focus groups, or old interviews, you can upload them right away and get a transcript and first-pass themes within moments.

Explore the suggested codes, merge or rename them, and start shaping the findings to your brief. Even better, use a recording (or multiple) that you’ve recently gone over manually, then compare them side by side and you’ll see first-hand how much time you could be saving. 

## **The Bottom Line**

Aida enhances your research practice, it doesn’t replace it. By handling the tedious admin work, it frees practitioners to focus on analysis while giving managers confidence in faster, more reliable outputs. The result is less admin and more insight for researchers, and a much clearer ROI across projects for managers.

**Try Aida in your next study and see the difference.**
