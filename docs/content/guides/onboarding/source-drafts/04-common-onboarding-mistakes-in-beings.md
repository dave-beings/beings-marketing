# **Common Onboarding Mistakes in Beings (and How to Avoid Them)**

Adopting a new platform always comes with a learning curve. Even experienced researchers can slip into old habits or overlook features that would make life easier. The key is to find what works best for you early on, and the good news is that most of Beings’ onboarding mistakes are simple to fix. So don’t worry, you’ll get the swing of it in no time.

Most onboarding issues can be solved with a few small changes. For example, if you want a stronger output from Aida, it might be that you need to start asking sharper questions, refining your prompts to get more useful answers.

Let’s take a look at the top five mistakes, how to fix them, and an example of how each one works in practice.

## **Mistake 1: Treating Beings Like a Generic Transcription Tool**

New users often upload transcripts and skim summaries, using Beings as little more than a transcription service. This saves *some* time but misses the real depth of Aida’s features. By doing this, you end up using Beings just for admin rather than as a tool to speed up analysis.

**How to fix it:** Dig deeper. Use coding suggestions, thematic clustering, and contradiction detection. After your batch of interviews, don’t just export neat write-ups, ask Aida: *“What contradictions did participants express about pricing versus value?”*

**In practice:** At first, the summaries from a staff training project suggested only that *“people were frustrated.”* By using Aida to cluster responses by role, the picture became clearer: sales managers felt the training was too detailed, while support staff felt it didn’t go deep enough. Instead of one vague recommendation to “improve training,” you now have two targeted, role-specific actions. These insights directly inform strategy rather than just saving time on admin.

## **Mistake 2: Uploading in Bulk Without Structuring First**

It’s tempting to dump transcripts and notes into Beings and “sort it out later.” But without tags, projects blur together and cross-study analysis becomes messy. Six months on, you may struggle to trace which file belongs to which study, slowing your work down and making it harder for stakeholders to follow.

**How to fix it:** Apply simple tags before uploading: project name, method (e.g. depth interview, ethnography, etc.), and respondent type (customer, staff, prospect). With that structure in place, Aida can make more distinct comparisons across time. It also makes it easier for you to locate what you need.

**In practice:** By tagging a culture survey by role, you can instantly ask Aida: *“How do customer-facing staff and back-office staff differ in their perceptions of company culture?”* What might have taken hours of manual comparison becomes a single, focused query. Structured data compounds in value, turning isolated projects into a navigable knowledge base that leaders can trust.

## **Mistake 3: Expecting Aida to Replace Researcher Judgement**

Some teams treat Aida’s summaries as final analysis, and that’s a warning sign that you’re relying too heavily on it. Interpretation is still the researcher’s job. Qualitative research relies on nuance, something only researchers can bring. For example, words like “frustration” or “confusion” mean different things depending on tone, context, or demographic. Over-reliance on AI risks findings that lack substance or feel generic.

**How to fix it:** Use Aida as a first step for highlighting themes, then apply your expertise. If “frustration” emerges, check transcripts: was it directed at the product, the workflow, or the user’s own knowledge? That layer of judgement is what keeps insights credible.

**In practice:** Imagine Aida flagged “confusion” in digital banking interviews. On closer inspection, confusion stemmed mostly from older respondents new to mobile apps. Instead of calling for a full redesign, you recommend targeted onboarding for specific demographics. The AI spotted the signal; your expertise uncovered the *why*. This balance is what gives stakeholders confidence in the findings.

## **Mistake 4: Ignoring Collaboration Features**

Old habits die hard. Many researchers still work solo, exporting findings to share later. This sidesteps one of Beings’ biggest advantages: **real-time collaboration**. Without it, stakeholders only see polished outputs and miss the reasoning trail. That reduces transparency and slows decision-making when questions arise too late.

**How to fix it:** Invite colleagues into projects early. Use shared highlights, comments, and tags to document your thinking. Let stakeholders observe themes as they emerge, or even add their own questions for Aida.

**In practice:** In a multi-country project, researchers organised transcripts by region and customer type and added comments on emotional triggers. When a senior manager joined the project mid-way, they could immediately see how raw quotes linked to emerging themes. By the time the final recommendations were delivered, trust was already established. Collaboration made the process smoother and gave stakeholders a clear view of the value.

## **Mistake 5: Not Setting Clear Questions for Aida**

A vague prompt like *“What did people say?”* produces vague answers. This can make Aida feel unfocused or imprecise, when in reality it’s a question of input quality. Precision matters. Without it, you risk missing the opportunity to tie findings back to your study objectives.

**How to fix it:** Frame prompts as research questions. Instead of *“What did participants think of the app?”*, ask *“What barriers did participants mention when using the onboarding feature?”* Clear questions lead to actionable answers.

**In practice:** A diary study query of *“What did customers think of shopping?”* returned broad impressions. Reframed to *“What caused customers to abandon carts before checkout?”*, Aida highlighted two levers: shipping costs and payment options. The client could address both of these immediately.

## **The Fix is Simple**

These mistakes are normal in the first weeks of using Beings, but none of them are permanent. With small adjustments, like structuring your uploads and creating clearer prompts, you’ll become confident in no time.

For leaders, smooth onboarding equates to fewer wasted hours, as well as insights that are both credible and strategically aligned. The sooner you put these habits into practice, the faster you and your team will get comfortable with Aida and start reaping the rewards.
