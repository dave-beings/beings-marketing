# **Troubleshooting Aida**

Even the best tools hit a bump every now and then. Aida is designed to make analysis faster and more reliable, but like all AI platforms, there are moments where the output doesn’t match your expectations. The good news? Most problems are easy to fix. You just need to adjust your approach.

This guide collects the most common questions researchers ask when using Aida and offers straightforward solutions. Use it as a quick reference when something feels “off,” and remember: you’re not alone. These are the same issues every AI user encounters.

## **FAQ About Aida by Beings**

### **File and Upload Issues**

#### **1*. “Some of my files won’t upload. What’s going on?”***

Large or complex files sometimes exceed the upload limits. For example, oversized PDFs or unusual formats may not be supported. Aida will flag which files can’t be processed so you know exactly what’s missing.

**Fix:**

* Split large documents into smaller “sub-documents” (e.g. chapters).  
* Re-save or compress heavy files.  
* Focus on uploading the sections you actually need to analyse.

#### **2\. *“Aida said it would summarise my files… and then didn’t.”***

This happens most often when you request summaries of a very large set of files at once. Instead of summarising, Aida lists the files it can access, but occasionally the follow-up output doesn’t appear. It can get stuck with a loading message that never arrives.

**Fix:**

* Ask for summaries in smaller batches (e.g. 5–10 documents at a time).  
* Re-run the request with a fresh prompt.  
* If needed, refresh your session.

#### **3\. *“Why is Aida repeating the same output?”***

When you ask Aida to process a very large number of files at once, it can occasionally get stuck and repeat the same answer (for example, looping on one document over and over). This usually happens because the query is too broad or targets too many files for a single run.

**Fix:**

* Reduce the batch size (e.g. summarise 5–10 files at a time).  
* Be explicit in your prompt about variety: *“Summarise each file separately, do not repeat.”*  
* If it still loops, refresh your session and retry with a smaller selection.

### Output Quality Issues

#### **4\. *“Why are Aida’s answers vague or generic?”***

AI is only as good as the prompt it’s given. A request like “Summarise this interview” will produce a surface-level overview.

**Fix:**

* Be specific about what you want: “Summarise this interview in 5 bullet points focusing on frustrations with online checkout.”  
* Ask for direct quotes to increase richness.  
* Use follow-up prompts to dig deeper.

#### **5\. *“Aida seems to only draw on a handful of sources, not all my uploads.”***

When you give Aida dozens of documents, it prioritises the most relevant ones rather than sampling evenly from all of them. This is designed to reduce noise. 

**Fix:**

* Add to your prompt: *“Draw on as many sources as possible and show which ones were used.”*  
* Run several narrower prompts (e.g. “Summarise perspectives on sustainability from 2010–2015” vs. “Summarise all 80 files”).  
* Run the query on fewer files at a time.

#### **6\. *“Why do I get different answers to the same question?”***

Aida, like any large language model, doesn’t produce a single “fixed” answer. Each run generates a fresh response based on your data and your wording. That’s why one query may yield slightly different phrasing or examples the next time.

**Fix:**

* If you need consistency, export the output you like and reuse it.  
* Save prompts that work well in your Prompt Library.  
* Add instructions like *“Be consistent with previous answers”* to reduce variation.

#### **7\. *“Why is Aida taking so long to respond?”***

Delays are usually caused by one of three things: large file sets, a complex multi-part prompt, or a slow internet connection.

**Fix:**

* Break big jobs into smaller requests.  
* Simplify prompts into stages.  
* Check your internet connection and refresh the page if needed.

#### **8\. *“The formatting looks messy when I copy-paste Aida’s output into Word or Slides.”***

When you copy text directly, you may pick up hidden formatting from the web interface.

**Fix:**

* Use “paste without formatting” in your destination tool.  
* Click the “Convert to note” button underneath the output and copy from there instead.  
* Create and reuse templates so you can slot Aida’s text into a consistent style.

#### **9\. *“Aida missed something I know is in my transcript. Did it skip text?”***

Aida doesn’t skip content, but it may summarise or paraphrase in ways that feel incomplete. If your prompt is vague, it may leave out details you care about.

**Fix:**

* Ask for specifics: *“Pull every mention of frustration with delivery times, including direct quotes.”*  
* Cross-check with search: type the keyword into Aida to confirm.  
* Use coding suggestions to capture more granular detail.

### **Access and Performance Issues**

#### **10\. *“I can’t log in / I’ve lost access to a project.”***

Most login issues stem from expired sessions or missing permissions.

**Fix:**

* Reset your password if you can’t get in.  
* Check that your account has the right project permissions.  
* Ask a project admin to re-invite you if needed.

#### 11\. *“How do I know if it’s me or the tool?”*

When something feels “stuck,” it’s natural to wonder if you did something wrong or if Aida is at fault.

**Quick diagnostic checklist:**

* Refresh your browser and check your internet.  
* Re-upload the file in case it didn’t process correctly.  
* Simplify your prompt.  
* If the issue persists across sessions, it may be a genuine bug. Contact support with details.

## **A Scenario in Practice**

You’ve uploaded a library of 20 research reports. You ask Aida, *“Give me a summary of the main themes.”* The result feels thin, as though it only drew from a few documents. Instead of assuming Aida can’t handle the full set, you adjust your approach: *“List three key insights from each of these reports, and show which document you’re pulling from.”*

The new output clearly references a wide spread of sources, making it obvious which files contributed to which themes. Now you’ve got traceable evidence for your analysis rather than a general overview.

## **Why This Matters for Managers**

Every problem solved on the spot is one less delay. By preparing for the worst, you already have the toolkit to survive when things don’t go to plan. 

In the end, small hiccups are normal. A tweak here and a change there, and you’ll have the solution in no time. Hopefully this troubleshooting guide will help you maintain momentum.
