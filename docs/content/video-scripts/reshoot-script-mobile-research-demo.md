## Script

### [SCENE START]

**[00:00]**  
**Sarah**: Hi, is that Emily?

**Emily**: Oh, hi. Hi. Yes, how are you Sarah?

**[00:04]**  
**Sarah**: I'm good. Thank you so much for agreeing to take part today. How are you doing?

**Emily**: Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

**[00:09]**  
**Sarah**: Great. Okay, lovely. So, I'll do a quick intro of who I am and why we're here today.

- I'm Sarah, the user researcher on the Android team.
- My job is to test things out to make sure they work well for people like you.
- Feel free to be as honest as you like today about whatever we show you.

Before we start, as you know, I'll be recording this session.
- Some of my colleagues will be watching as well.
- They might ask me some questions to pass along to you.
- Don't worry, I'll handle those as they come in.

Could you please confirm that you received the package we sent you?

**[00:44]**  
**Emily**: Yes, I did.

**[00:45]**  
**Sarah**: Great. And are you set up as per the instructions?

**Emily**: Yes.

**Sarah**: Lovely. Okay. So can I ask you to turn the camera on?

**[00:51]**  
**Emily**: Sure. Uh, I think I've turned it on.

**[00:55]**  
**Sarah**: Great. That's excellent. I can see some pictures coming through. Now I'd like you to show me how you'd set up your new Android phone.
- Think aloud as you're going along.
- Shout if you need anything.

### Device Setup Sequence

**[01:06]**  
**Emily**: Um, so I've turned on my Motorola. I guess I just start... is it okay if I skip my SIM card? It's asking me to insert my SIM card.

**[01:17]**  
**Sarah**: Yep, that's fine.

**[01:23]**  
**Emily**: Um, and it says 'privacy and software updates'. I think I'd just 'accept and continue'... and now it's 'getting your phone ready'. And now it says 'copy apps and data'... you can choose to transfer your apps, photos, contacts, Google account and more... I'll say 'next', and then it says 'use your old device', you need an old Android or iPhone device. Turn it on and keep it unlocked.

So I'll just unlock my iPhone.

Um, and then next on this, 'find your old device cable'. Use a cable that fits your old device.

Okay. So I've got the cable here.

And then it says 'scan the QR code with your iPhone or iPad camera'.

### QR Code and App Download

**[02:15]**  
**Sarah**: Okay. Lovely. Can you show me what you do next?

**[02:17]**  
**Emily**: Yes, I'm gonna... um, so I've scanned the QR code and it's an app that's called 'Switch to Android'. Um, I guess I'd download that.

**[02:40]**  
**Sarah**: MM-Hmm. And how do you feel about... about scanning the QR code and then downloading an app at this stage?

**[02:45]**  
**Emily**: I, I'm very familiar with scanning QR codes, but um, I didn't expect it to ask me to download an app. I thought they would just, you know, like scan a QR code and everything would be transferred there. And then now it says 'choose what to copy from your iPhone'... contacts, calendar events. Uh, okay. I'll just continue.

Okay. It says it's copying my data.

### Data Transfer Process

**[03:09]**  
**Sarah**: Perfect. Okay. So can you talk me through what you just did?

**[03:12]**  
**Emily**: Um, I just um, allowed certain things to be accessed and transferred to the other phone. Um, and it looks like I had an option to either, you know, change it after I've tapped onto each of the 'Okay' buttons

**[03:29]**  
**Sarah**: Perfect. And are there any data types that you'd expect to be able to transfer with this app that aren't available?

**[03:35]**  
**Emily**: Data types as in like things on my phone that I'd like to transfer?

**Sarah**: Yeah.

**Emily**: Mm. Calendar events are good. Um, I don't know... like would they copy the apps as well? Um, like the apps that I've downloaded on my phone... like I might want them to be copied onto the new phone as well so I don't need to redownload all of the apps.

### Research Package Feedback

**[03:59]**  
**Sarah**: Okay. Interesting. Can you tell me about your experience with the research package we sent you? How easy was that to set up?

**[04:08]**  
**Emily**: Oh, it was easy. Um, I mean, yeah, I think I didn't know what to expect, and then it looked all fine and instructions were quite clear, so yeah.

### Satisfaction Rating

**[04:17]**  
**Sarah**: Cool. Okay. And what was your overall satisfaction with the 'Switch to Android' app? One being extremely dissatisfied, seven being extremely satisfied.

**[04:27]**  
**Emily**: So when you say the app, do you mean the app that I had to download?

**Sarah**: Yes

**Emily**: Okay. Um, I mean... one is dissatisfied and seven is very satisfied... overall, maybe a four, 'cause it wasn't super easy, but it wasn't very hard.

### Improvement Suggestions

**[04:51]**  
**Sarah**: You mentioned you um, rated the app overall four out of seven. Is there anything we could um, I guess add to the app or change to make that rating a little bit higher in the future?

**[05:04]**  
**Emily**: I mean the uh, the network part definitely was unclear to me, because if you didn't tell me to do that, I probably wouldn't have done that. And if I couldn't transfer my data, I might end up like just setting up my Motorola from scratch without transferring much data, because that looked like I had to join a network that is not my home wifi, and it was just a bit weird.

### Colleague Question

**[05:27]**  
**Sarah**: That makes sense. Okay, cool.

So, just had a question come in from one of my colleagues who's watching today.

Um, they want to know how would you check that all your data had actually been transferred today? What would you do?

**[05:39]**  
**Emily**: I would just go to my Motorola and um, uh, I would look at my home screen.

Right now Motorola is asking me if I want to sign... opt out from email, so I would just opt out... um, and I can choose light. Okay.

### Data Verification

**[06:06]**  
**Sarah**: So for instance, how would you know that all your contacts have been transferred? Where would you look?

**[06:10]**  
**Emily**: I would go... I mean, um, right now I am still at the setup, so I'd just go through that quickly, I guess.

Okay. I'm all done on Motorola... so I would just go to my contacts to see if I can find my contacts.

Oh yeah, I've got all my contacts here. Yeah.

**[06:26]**  
**Sarah**: Perfect. Thank you so much Emily. That was really helpful.

**[SCENE END]**
