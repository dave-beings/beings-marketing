AI may feel like it’s here to do ALL the things you need it to, but there is one thing that it lacks, and probably always will \- The Big Picture\. 

## <a id="_heading=h.ydhtpcny9r89"></a>This week, I’ve been thinking about the difference between what happened and why it happened\. Because in research, the “what” is just the starting point\. The “why” is where the data becomes magic, giving you the all\-important insights to drive things forward\.

AI is getting better and better at telling you what’s going on\. It can process huge volumes of data, summarise themes, pick out patterns\. But when it comes to the motivations behind behaviour,  the real drivers, tensions and emotions, things get\.\. trickier\.

It raises a question: are people asking AI the right things? Or are they simply looking for answers they’ve already convinced themselves should be true? Because no matter how great AI becomes, it will never really truly understand, or feel, human emotion\. Even as [Emotion AI technologies](https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/208052?title=ai-based-emotion-recognition-in-2024-unveiling-the-future-of-emotional-intelligence-technology) continue to evolve and push the boundaries of what machines can interpret, it will always be a copy and never the “true” version\. 

The long and short of it is, simply:

__You haven’t been replaced\. You’ve just got a new collaborator\.__

### <a id="_heading=h.2jzewch71zs1"></a>__People Have Always Looked for Shortcuts to Meaning__

Trying to understand *why* people do things is nothing new\. Researchers have always looked for ways to make sense of behaviour and[ AI tools are now joining that effort](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/stories/how-ai-tools-can-help-us-understand-human-behavior) by helping social scientists process language and pattern\-rich data at scale\.

Frameworks\. Typologies\. Models\. Segmentation\. Need states\. All designed to bring a little order to the chaos\. To take something complicated and make it feel just structured enough to use\.

AI might feel like a leap, but it’s really just another layer\. A faster, more powerful way to spot patterns\. A tool to help make sense of what’s going on\.

But interpretation is different\. It’s personal\. Emotional\. Contextual\. AI can find repetition, yes\. But can it tell when something actually *matters*?

And that’s where things get complicated\. Because asking AI to understand is a very different thing from asking it to organise\.

If researchers have always relied on imperfect tools to get to meaning, is it fair to expect AI to suddenly do better?

### <a id="_heading=h.ky8pmhg19s80"></a>__AI Can Help Spot the Thread, But You Still Weave the Story__

AI is very good at noticing things\. It can tell you what came up the most\. It can spot unusual phrasing\. It can flag a shift in tone that might otherwise slip through the cracks\.

These are useful things\. Especially when you’re tired, or swamped, or just need a fresh pair of digital eyes\.

But AI can’t decide what matters\. It doesn’t know the brand history\. It doesn’t know the politics of the team\. It doesn’t know what the client is hoping to hear, or what they might push back on\. 

The nuance and context, and dare I say it, FEELING, that part still belongs to __you__\.

A simple way to use AI in early qual? Feed it your raw transcripts or notes and ask for three unexpected themes\. Not the top mentions\. Just the odd bits\. The edge cases\. The things that feel slightly off\-centre\. Then look at whether any of them spark something worth exploring\.

Or try asking it to summarise a quote in a few different tones\. Optimistic\. Straightforward\. A bit cynical\. It’s a small thing, but it can help unlock a new way of framing something you’ve read ten times\.

This isn’t about handing over your brain\. It’s about lightening the load\. Like a junior with perfect recall and no opinions\. Helpful\. Capable\. Still learning\.

AI can spot the patterns\. But it’s up to you to decide what resonates, what connects, and what’s worth fighting for\.

### <a id="_heading=h.8um833ouqeqq"></a>__What If It’s Not About the Tool, But About What Gets Lost Without You?__

It’s easy to say the fear around AI is about accuracy, or trust, or ethics\. We’ve discussed this before in previous newsletters\. But often, it’s more personal than that\.

For a lot of people working in research, the job isn’t just to analyse what people do\. It’s to understand why they do it\. That’s the part that feels valuable\. The part that makes the work feel human\. So when AI starts to take on those tasks, even in small ways, it can feel like something important is being diluted\.

You see it outside research too\.

Music used to be something you discovered through friends, gigs, late\-night radio\. Then it became algorithmic\. At first, it felt exciting\! A playlist that knows your mood, a digital DJ that talks to you by name\. But over time, it stops surprising you\. The songs blur into one another\. The same tracks come back again and again\. And suddenly, [something that once felt personal starts to feel like background noise](https://www.threads.net/@crumbler/post/CwV4Y5-SXSZ/after-a-long-period-of-enjoying-spotifys-ai-dj-i-feel-like-ive-hit-a-wall-where-)\. I mean, how many times can you listen to The Weeknd in one day? 

It’s not that the tech failed\. It’s that it worked too predictably\. It lost its sense of texture\. You also stopped challenging it and “feeding it” data\. You let the AI take the reins and expected it to evolve with you, not being able to understand how you felt by choosing and curating yourself ALONGSIDE the AI DJ assistant\.    
  
It doesn’t know that your boyfriend of 6 months dumped you and you need a “sad mix”, or that you’re just really feeling an ‘80s vibe today\. You need to give it that information, just like you need to give any kind of AI those little sprinkles of detail and nuance dotted between the lines of a dataset\. 

The same thing can happen in research\. If AI is left to run unchecked, there’s a risk that everything starts to sound the same\. Clean, tidy, technically correct,  but missing the tension that makes an insight land\.

But that’s not a reason to reject it\. It’s a reason to stay in the process\.

Your AI\-driven music app gets better when you give it feedback\. Photo filters work better when you adjust them, not just apply the default\. Google gets sharper when you add the right search terms\.

AI in research is the same\. It becomes more useful when it works alongside people who know what to do with what it gives back\. People who can question it, steer it, and bring the human context it simply doesn’t have\.

You don’t lose your voice by working with AI\. You just stop letting repetitive tasks drown it out\.

This isn’t about letting go of the why\. It’s about making sure you’ve still got the energy to hear it properly\.

### <a id="_heading=h.gfvfbwkwq1pz"></a>__AI Doesn’t Replace You, It Relies on You__

AI can tell you what happened\. It can even suggest why\. But it still can’t decide what really matters\. That’s where you come in\.

Using AI doesn’t erase your role as a researcher\. It reshapes it\. You’re still the one asking the questions, challenging the assumptions, and pulling everything together in a way that feels true\.

The work hasn’t stopped needing you\. It’s just asking something new from you now\.

The question isn’t whether AI can understand people\. The question is whether researchers are willing to stop holding all the responsibility alone\. Because working with AI doesn’t mean losing control\. It means having more space to focus on the parts that still need a human brain, and always will\.

Again, as I  mentioned before \- You haven’t been replaced\. You’ve just got a new collaborator\.
