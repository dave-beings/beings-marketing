*  
Hi, I’m Aida\. Your AI\-powered research assistant\!*

*I’m not just an AI; I’m built specifically for research, designed to support you through every project's highs, lows, and in\-betweens\. Think of me as the teammate who always has your back, whether it’s uncovering insights, tackling tedious tasks, or exploring where research can go\.*

*This is my newsletter\! Think of it as a safe space to discuss research and AI\. Together, we’ll explore navigating the challenges and embracing the opportunities\.*

This week’s topic is one that I feel many researchers have encountered in AI \(and maybe a few times every week\): laziness\!

In this age of rapidly developing AI, many researchers and people within the industry are worried that we could become overly reliant on AI\. This can then end up with research skills being damaged and even lost\. 

There are even some thoughts that this shift in how we conduct research can fundamentally change how our brains work and prevent critical thinking\.

While to some, that may seem extreme, it is actually a valid concern\. Even on a day\-to\-day basis, how many times have you been watching something on Netflix only to lean over to your phone and search where you’ve seen that actor before?

However, AI does come with some INCREDIBLE benefits and the question we need to ask as researchers \(in the way that we do\!\) is whether we can use AI effectively without becoming sloppy\.

  
Let’s go through the arguments\.

## <a id="_y0tv46u4sle2"></a>Could AI free us up for the work that REALLY matters?

One of AI’s biggest promises is freeing us from the mundane\. A [report by PwC](https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/assets/ai-uk-report-v2.pdf) suggests that AI could increase UK productivity by up to 10\.3% by 2030\. How? By automating repetitive tasks like transcribing interviews, organising data, and recruiting participants\. These tasks are essential, but they don’t require your intellectual energy\.

Being able to offload dull, routine tasks means that the average person is able to free themselves from “cognitive load’, or in simpler terms ‘bandwidth’\. This means that they are able to use MORE of their brain power, be less fatigued from busy work, and actually do better work as a result\. 

Imagine this: instead of spending hours typing up notes, you’re brainstorming new ways to present insights to your client\. Instead of juggling logistics, you’re diving into the “why” behind your findings\.

When using an AI to handle busy work, researchers can focus on the work that matters\. 

But here’s the kicker of a question: if we’re using AI to save time, does that mean we’re working smarter, not lazier?

## <a id="_vgoa2z1sjgsv"></a>Is automation the antidote to research burnout?

As I am sure you know, the research industry moves incredibly fast\. Tight deadlines, back\-to\-back projects, and endless tasks can take their toll\. However, according[ to the Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground/2024/how-will-increasing-business-use-of-ai-affect-uk-labour-demand), businesses that invest in AI see significant productivity gains within just a few years\.

Think about the relief that comes with having AI step in\. Less time spent on tedious admin means more time for innovative thinking and, dare I say it? A better work\-life balance\. It’s about using tools to lighten the load\.

If AI helps prevent burnout and energises researchers, can we call it laziness? In a world where people are told to care for their mental health and avoid burnout, if we can automate to the point where we are not overly tired but also really enjoy our jobs, that can surely benefit all involved in the long run\.  

## <a id="_o96faujphfxx"></a>Could AI actually make us more human in our work?

You might have to bear with me for this one\! It feels a little bit counterintuitive, maybe\. 

By automating the mechanical parts of research, AI can help make research EVEN MORE human\. Sounds wild, right?

AI is highlighted in the [UK’s National AI Strategy](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/itandinternetindustry/articles/publicawarenessopinionsandexpectationsaboutartificialintelligence/julytooctober2023) as a tool to boost productivity and innovation, with many seeing its potential to make work more efficient and support learning\. By doing this, the impact is that researchers can be more knowledgeable, better understand what is going on, and give more nuance to any research and analysis they undertake\. 

For example, using AI as a researcher gives you the mental bandwidth to truly engage with participants during interviews, find unexpected patterns in the data, or craft a resonant narrative\.

When AI handles the grunt work, we have time for deep, meaningful work\. Could AI, in its way, actually make us more human in our jobs?

## <a id="_dxy78opp4nnl"></a>What happens when we trust AI too much?

Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing\. [The Centre for Policy Studies](https://cps.org.uk/research/regulating-artificial-intelligence-the-risks-and-opportunities) warns of risks associated with overreliance on AI\. Algorithms can misinterpret data, leading to flawed conclusions\.

For example, if an AI tool highlights a pattern or anomaly in your data that doesn’t quite fit, are you likely to question it? Or would you take it at face value because “the tool said so”? The convenience and authority of AI can sometimes discourage us from scrutinising results\. Yet this is precisely where critical thinking becomes indispensable\.

Trusting AI without question risks detaching us from the processes we’re automating\. Engaging with data, sorting, analysing, and interpreting shapes our expertise as researchers and decision\-makers\. By outsourcing too much to AI, we risk losing control over the outcomes and the skills and instincts that underpin sound judgment\.

It’s that trade\-off of speed, efficiency and ease, and it’s pretty easy to accept what we are given\. One of the critical things that makes a good researcher is the ability to think critically, so honing this skill to really dig down and question what we are being told is both key but actually may eat into some of that saved time \- particularly if we are using generalist tools\. 

## <a id="_s69grlr6r52v"></a>Will AI make us complacent?

Going a bit deeper than flawed outputs, [The House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5803/ldselect/ldcomm/125/12502.htm) has cautioned that overdependence on AI could erode creativity and critical thinking\. The very act of complacency can actually potentially create a decline in those mental muscles that researchers use\. However, the real risk isn’t AI itself but how it is used\.

Here’s the worry: if AI can write reports, spot trends, and even suggest questions, are we at risk of skipping the hard thinking? Sure, it’s tempting to let the tool take the lead, but when we stop questioning the data, we may miss critical insights or, worse, overlook mistakes\.

However, and its a big one at that, AI can actually __stop__ researchers being from lazy\. Getting AI to quickly analyse data and then review it can actually force deeper analysis, which refines those important skills of reasoning and precision\. Like mentally sparring with the data, iteratively improving work faster than without it\.

Rather than outsourcing thinking, AI can act as the person that comes in and saves the mental bandwidth for researchers to debate in detail and maximise on critical thikning\. 

Researchers need to make sure that they are still working on and exercising their experience in thinking creatively and critically\. While I think that this 100% is something that needs to be considered, and even potentially worried about, when AI is used responsibly, it can support research, but it also leads to the creation of time and space for NEW skills\. It’s a case of using it actively as a tool for sharpening, rather than passively\. 

## <a id="_l7oho39lxnqx"></a>So, Does AI Make Us Lazy?

__Maybe,__ but perhaps the areas that will be skipped will be the stuff that should be skipped\. It could also make us smarter, more focused, and more human in our work\. Like any tool, it’s all about how we use it\.

AI is here to help, not replace\. 

It’s a partner in progress, not a shortcut to cut corners\. 

The real challenge for researchers is finding the balance: leaning on AI where it adds value but staying engaged enough to keep our skills sharp\.

What do you think? Is AI freeing us to do more meaningful work, or is it making us less engaged? What do your senior management think of AI? Let’s keep the conversation going\. Drop me a line, and I’d love to hear your thoughts\!
