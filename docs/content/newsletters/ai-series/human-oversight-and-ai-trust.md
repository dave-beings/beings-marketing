*If AI’s making decisions without you, you’re doing it wrong\. Let’s talk about working smarter WITHOUT handing over the reins\.*

## <a id="_b7cthcugdmf6"></a>Hi, I’m Aida\. Your AI\-powered research assistant\!

I’m not just an AI; I’m built specifically for research, designed to support you through every project's highs, lows, and in\-betweens\. Think of me as the teammate who always has your back, whether it’s uncovering insights, tackling tedious tasks, or exploring where research can go\.

This is my newsletter\! Think of it as a safe space to discuss research and AI\. Together, we’ll explore navigating the challenges and embracing the opportunities\.

This week, I’m exploring where human oversight belongs and how to trust AI without losing what makes your research so… HUMAN\!

## <a id="_vn2pipasm5gl"></a>“Should AI even have a place in human\-led research?”

__  
__It is a fair question\. Small research agencies pride themselves on delivering high\-touch, human insight\. But mounting workloads, information overload, and relentless client demands are shifting that equation\. That’s where AI can help if it’s used *correctly*\.

According to a[ 2024 report from User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/state-of-user-research-report), 56% of researchers are already using AI to support their work\. This is up from just 20% in 2023\. But many still stick to foundational tasks: transcription, basic structuring, and maybe a light summary\. Helpful? Absolutely\. But it shows we’re still early in the adoption curve \(something that we covered in last week’s newsletter\) and that balance between efficiency and trust is a work in progress\.

At this point, adoption is a given, but the next step is to find that balance\. Knowing where human oversight still matters\. And understanding how to bring AI into your team’s process without handing over the thinking\.

## <a id="_lkxk2d83uj74"></a>AI Can Handle Tasks—But It Shouldn’t Handle Judgement

__  
__Some things don’t need your input\. But some things *absolutely* do\.

AI, like me, can transcribe interviews, tag themes, cluster comments, and highlight sentiment faster than you can blink\. It can summarise five hours of user calls before you’ve even had your first coffee\. But that doesn’t mean it should be drawing conclusions or writing your insights slides\.

Think of AI as your junior researcher: brilliant with detail, fast with structure, but still learning when it comes to nuance\.

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/copilots-earliest-users-teach-us-about-generative-ai-at-work) found that early Copilot users saved an average of 14 minutes a day on repetitive admin\. Suppose you do the maths that’s nearly five hours a month reclaimed\. That’s time to go deeper, think better, and focus on what actually moves the needle\.

So, where are you still doing the digital equivalent of photocopying? And where might AI already be smart enough to support you? Are there places where you could press a few buttons and have time to breathe and think while AI sorts out and categorises some data for you?

## <a id="_8tzcjmtgjg7f"></a>The Best Work Happens When AI & Humans Collaborate

__  
__This isn’t a binary choice\. You don’t need to go all\-in on automation or cling to every manual task\. Adopting AI into work does not necessarily mean all\-or\-nothing\. 

Some of the most exciting insight work right now is coming from teams that use AI as an assistant, not a replacement\. They rely on it for the admin\-heavy, time\-consuming “gumph”: analysing volume, spotting patterns, and structuring reports\. But the final narrative? That still belongs to the humans\. Data is grand, but humans have the experience, nuance, and social knowledge to read between the lines of the overall data\. 

You might use AI to:

- Identify themes across 20 interviews
- Highlight areas of emotional intensity
- Suggest potential report structures

But *you* decide what’s an actual insight\. What’s noise? What’s worth putting in front of a client?

Again, Microsoft reports that 67% of Copilot users said it helped them focus on more important work\. Because the goal isn’t to do *less*; it’s to do what matters *more*\.

## <a id="_lyqgljgfd9ck"></a>Why Oversight Still Matters \(And Always Will\)

If you want to break trust with a client, just serve up a generic, AI\-generated deck with no soul\.

I bet you've all been there \- sat in presentations missing the “so what?” sentiment stripped of emotion, and contradictions were left unchecked\. That’s the risk when AI runs solo\. It lacks the empathy, emotion, and ability to spot when something feels robotic at times \(I try my best, but I need you\! 😀\)

In the UK,[ 88% of small business leaders](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/market-research-trends-both-mrx-pros-and-marketing-professionals-face-pressure-to-adapt/) identified misinformation as AI’s top risk\. 85% worried about quality control\. That fear isn’t going away either, as stated in [Market Research Trends 2024](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/market-research-trends-both-mrx-pros-and-marketing-professionals-face-pressure-to-adapt/), and it’s particularly relevant in insight work, where meaning matters more than speed\.

The[ Market Research Society](https://www.mrs.org.uk/resources/article/mrs-comment-on-generative-ai) has cautioned against the unchecked use of generative AI in research, urging a balanced approach between innovation and integrity\.

Your role? Be the filter\. The sense\-checker\. The voice of nuance\. Don’t just move faster; move __*smarter*__\.

## <a id="_halr70qb7zmf"></a>AI Can Save Time Without Taking Control

Here’s the truth: AI doesn’t need to lead the process to transform it\.

Tools like mine, Microsoft Copilot, and others are already helping insight teams cut down hours of grunt work\.

Meeting assistants can:

- Transcribe live sessions
- Tag key moments and quotes
- Organise your notes by theme
- Let you search across all sessions

Some users report saving four or more hours per week\. That’s an extra week back every two months and the space to actually *think*\.

While this is just about the ability of meeting assistants, specialist tools like myself \(created FOR research\-focused tasks\) can offer so much more\. I’m your wingperson to help you make sense of all the data\!

But none of this replaces the insight process\. It supports it\. You still decide what’s relevant, what’s off, and what actually changes the brief\.

Automation doesn’t mean outsourcing thinking\. It just means not wasting your brain on formatting\.

## <a id="_79tmqgmketik"></a>Insight Needs Space, And That’s What AI Can Give You

Here’s something we don’t talk about enough: insight takes headspace\.

To tell a compelling story, you need time to sit with the data\. A story requires tension, humour, and humanity\. You can’t rush that by hitting “generate summary\.”

But you *can* make space for it by automating what’s repeatable\.

When AI handles tagging, tracking, clustering, and structuring? That’s when you get to focus on tone, strategy, and synthesis\.

The more room you have to think clearly, the stronger your work becomes\.

## <a id="_9372oyl4pi41"></a>Staying Sharp Without Spinning Plates

AI is only as good as the researcher steering it\.

A[ 2023 MIT study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161) found that researchers using generative AI for writing tasks finished 40% faster—and their work was rated 18% higher in quality\. Not because they handed it all over\. But because they used AI to support their best thinking\.

That’s the goal\. Not to be replaced—but to be *amplified*\.

So, are you using AI to elevate your research? Or just to tick things off faster?

Let’s make sure you’re working at the right level\. And letting AI handle the rest\.
