<a id="_22lhn4wydguc"></a>Research Teams Are Underskilled and Overpressured… Here’s Why

We’ve covered this before, and I’m sure we’ll cover it again, because it never really stops being relevant\.

Every company wants more\. More growth, more efficiency, more value from the same headcount\. Even if you’re in one of those lovely SME agencies with a great culture and supportive clients, you’re still working with companies who have shareholders to answer to\. And shareholders expect one thing: rapid growth\.

That’s fair enough\. It’s the job\. But sometimes the pressure to squeeze every last drop clouds the work itself\.

### <a id="_43j11l93afbl"></a>__What You Need to Know__

__The problem  
__Research teams are being asked to deliver more in less time\. Training and skill\-building get pushed aside\. Instead of growing expertise, teams are firefighting\. AI often gets pulled in as a shortcut, not as a partner\.

__Why it matters  
__Underskilled and overpressured teams end up with shallow insights, burnt\-out researchers, and disappointed clients\. The quality gap isn’t always visible at first, but over time it chips away at credibility\.

__Where it breaks__

- Juniors left to sink without proper development  

- Training budgets frozen or forgotten  

- AI used as a plaster for weak process  

- Short\-term outputs prioritised over long\-term trust  

- Everyone busy, but not necessarily getting better

### <a id="_nbmp8kxpc88y"></a>__Reflection On How We Got Here__

This isn’t about being anti\-business, anti\-profit, or anti\-shareholder\. We’re pro all of those things\. They’re what keep agencies alive\. But we’re also pro\-research and pro\-craft\. And sometimes there’s a disconnect\.

When growth targets drown out the smaller details, the space to train, to reflect, to build skill, the quality of the work slips\. 

The irony is that the small things are what make the big things possible\. A thoughtful brief, a properly developed researcher, an extra hour spent sitting with data before the deck gets built, those details compound into trust\. And trust compounds into profit\.

AI has a role to play here\. Not as a plaster, but as a partner\. Used well, it gives researchers space to focus on the human skills\. These are the things like the listening, the interpretation, the nuance, that no shortcut can replace\.

### <a id="_6oqxdzfsgcvj"></a>__The Evidence You Can’t Ignore__

And just to be clear, this isn’t some abstract gripe about the “state of the industry\.” The data tells the same story\. [GreenBook’s GRIT report in 2024 ](https://www.quantilope.com/resources/company-news-greenbook-confirms-automation-and-agility-as-hot-topics)had automation and speed sitting right at the top of the agenda\. That doesn’t come out of nowhere\. It’s a signal of how much pressure agencies are under to keep things moving, to shave hours off projects, to hit tighter deadlines with fewer hands\.

But here’s the contradiction, [ESOMAR’s global report in 2023](https://researchworld.com/articles/the-ongoing-transformation-of-market-research-methods), showed investment in qualitative methods had more than doubled in the past two years\. Seventeen billion dollars is flowing into the slower, more thoughtful side of the work\. Clients still want depth\. They still want the stories and the nuance\. They’re paying more for it than ever\.

So which is it? Faster, cheaper, automated, or richer, slower, human? The reality is that agencies are being asked to do both at once\. To move at speed and deliver depth\. To run lean and still invest in skill\. No wonder teams end up caught in the middle, looking for shortcuts to square the circle\.

### <a id="_2nuupbew1eac"></a>__Where We Go From Here__

The pressure is not going anywhere\. Growth targets will keep tightening, deadlines will keep creeping forward, and clients will always want more\. That is simply the reality of working in this industry\. The choice is not whether the pressure exists, but how we decide to respond to it\.

We can keep squeezing and plugging the gaps with shortcuts, pushing teams harder and faster until the talent pipeline dries up\. Or we can use the tools we already have, including AI, in a way that lifts the weight of the repetitive tasks and gives people back the time and space to focus on the work that only humans can do\. Listening carefully, interpreting with care, spotting the patterns that matter, and making sense of the mess\.

Because insight does not come from constant motion\. It comes from the pauses\. It comes from people who have the breathing room to notice subtleties, connect the dots, and shape ideas into something that builds trust\. If we can protect that space, the growth and the profit will follow\.
