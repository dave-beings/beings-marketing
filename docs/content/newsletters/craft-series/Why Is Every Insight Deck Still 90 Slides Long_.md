<a id="_9attfukrmsjd"></a>Why Is Every Insight Deck Still 90 Slides Long?

We have all the data we need, all the insights we need, but __we don’t need to use all of it\.__

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but __insight decks are still too long\. __

It happens in internal reviews, client meetings, stakeholder sessions, even workshops that were meant to be tight and focused\. What should be a summary turns into a catalogue\. Charts, verbatims, segments, models, rationales, and recommendations arrive one after another, often without a clear sense of which parts matter most or what anyone is meant to do with them\.

This isn’t because researchers are unclear on the story\. In most cases, they know what the work is really about\. But when timelines are tight, decisions are political, or multiple teams feed into one document, the pressure to show everything gets hard to resist\. The result is familiar: too many slides, too much repetition, too many things left in for safety, too much of too much essentially\. 

If the person reading your work has to ask where to start, the deck isn’t doing its job\.

__What Do You Need To Know?__

### <a id="_7azpfdpv9hg"></a>__The problem__

Insight decks are too long\. What should be a sharp summary ends up as a full archive\. Charts, quotes, frameworks, observations, recommendations, and commentary all get added\. Not because they are all essential, but because no one wants to be the one who cuts\. The result is a deck that looks thorough but says too much and communicates too little\.

### <a id="_s3kwkq4gtupo"></a>__Why it matters__

These decks shape thinking\. They steer decisions\. When they are overloaded, people switch off\. The key points get lost\. Decisions take longer or land on the wrong thing\. And the actual value, the core thinking that took time and effort to get right, ends up buried under detail no one asked for\.

### <a id="_g8rb0uggeq28"></a>__Where it breaks__

- No one takes ownership of the final cut  

- Everyone wants their part included  

- “Just in case” wins over “what matters”  

- AI tools make it easier to add than to decide  

- People assume detail equals value, even when it doesn’t

## <a id="_aetvsaqf65sy"></a>Data Backed Deck Length

A longer deck might feel “better”, but it rarely leads to stronger outcomes\. Most stakeholders don’t want to see every theme\. They don’t need to be walked through the full logic of each step\. They want clarity on what they should take away and what happens next\.

On their website UK coaching firm, Benjamin Ball Associates, states that a good deck should be more like a CV than a full autobiography\. Their ideal structure includes[ just 10 to 15 slides](https://benjaminball.com/blog/perfect-pitch-deck-structure), designed to tell a compelling story without overloading the audience\. The message is simple \- keep it structured, focused and resist the urge to show every detail just because you have it\.

And it’s replicated across the board\. Another UK firm specialising in startup communications found that [decks with 11 to 20 slides are 43 per cent more likely to secure funding](https://www.robotmascot.co.uk/blog/how-long-should-an-investment-pitch-deck-be-length-content)\. On average, investors spend just__ three minutes and 44 seconds__ reviewing them\. Yes, that's data from the investment world, but pitching is pitching\. Whether you're trying to land funding or steer a business decision, the people in the room are often the same ones burning out from constant input and decision fatigue\. 

__They need a story that lands, and does it fast\.__

The instinct to include everything doesn’t come from confusion\. It comes from teams trying to do justice to work that took time, effort, and coordination\. You get material from different directions, and the easiest way to keep everyone happy is to include it all\. But that is deferral\. It’s keeping peace for peace’s sake, when that’s not going to help the end result\. 

When a deck turns into an encyclopedia, it’s not because the analysis wasn’t strong\. It’s because no one made a final call on what actually needed to be shared\. And by the time it reaches the people who need to act, the point has been buried under details that nobody needs\.

Good work needs structure, not explanation in every direction\. It needs a frame that tells people what they’re looking at and why it matters\. That takes trust in the work and confidence from the person delivering it\.

AI can support that, but only if it’s used to reduce uncertainty, not generate more noise\. If it helps test a theory, sense\-check a theme, or flag something you’ve missed, it’s doing something useful\. If it’s just pulling in more content because you’re not sure what to cut, it’s making the problem worse\.

One academic study found that AI performs well at early\-stage coding and theme identification in qualitative work, but still relies on human judgement to shape the final story\. Especially when that story needs to land with people who weren’t part of the research process\.

That’s where tools like Beings come in\. Not to create more material, but to help researchers focus\. To provide structure, preserve key language, and support confident decisions about what to share and what to let go\.

### <a id="_vtitpmfuocp1"></a>__We Don’t Need to Throw Away the Deck__

Most people don’t hate slides\. They hate feeling lost\. Hate having to search for the point\. Hate sitting through an hour of content when five minutes of clarity would have done the job\.

The real frustration kicks in when it becomes clear no one’s going to help\. No one’s going to guide them through\. Just slide after slide that almost says something, but not quite\.

A deck shouldn’t be a record of everything that was done\. It should be a way to show what matters now\. The rest belongs somewhere else, ready to be called upon if needed but not dumped in the middle of a deck that’s going to take half a working day to explain\. 

Stakeholders want clarity without being oversimplified\. They want to know the why, but not every step of how you got there\. Most of them just need to know what’s changed and what to do next\.

The job of a researcher is not to say everything\. It’s to make sure the right thing gets heard\.
