<a id="_heading=h.ficp81o8ya5z"></a>Your Research Is Only as Good as Your Ability to Sell It

__*STANDFIRST: *__*Yes, I said “sell”\. Don’t flinch\.*

You could be the best research agency in the entire world\.   
  
Clear objectives\. The most thoughtful questions\. Real “rigour”\.

  
Maybe you’ve even done all the lovely little extra bits on comms\. You’ve maybe tidied the deck, polished the story, and tightened up the recommendations\.

But if the client doesn’t get it?  
  
If they nod politely, thank you for your time, say they’ll look into it in more depth, and move on with their day?

__Then it hasn’t landed\.__

The reality is simply this: research that sits in a folder, untouched, isn’t insight\. It’s admin\.

__Your findings were probably strong\. They just didn’t make anyone feel anything\.__

And this is the part most people don’t want to face: being good at research isn’t the same as getting people to care about it\. The value of the work isn’t just in what you uncover, it’s in how you communicate it\. 

## <a id="_heading=h.e5r2vxpst43n"></a>If you want your research to drive real change, you have to be willing to present it like it matters\. Which means you can’t just think like a researcher\. You have to act like a salesperson…\.

What Do You Need to Know

__The problem?__

The role of the researcher is shifting and fast\. Clients want clear, confident answers, not just findings\. But most researchers have never been trained in how to make insight land\.

__Why it matters?__

AI is speeding up the process\. Tools like ChatGPT and Aida help with toplines and analysis, but the real value lies in how insight is delivered\. It doesn't make a difference if it doesn’t move the room\.

__Where it breaks?__

- AI boosts speed, but not clarity or relevance
- Delivery skills are rarely taught; they’re expected
- Clients want decision\-ready outputs, not just data
- Researchers are being pulled into strategy without support
- Insight lands flat if it’s not communicated with confidence

__What could help?__

- Treat delivery as part of the job, not an afterthought\.
- Build communication habits that make your findings actionable\.
- Use tools to free up time for what only you can do: reading the room, framing what matters, and helping people act\.

## <a id="_heading=h.n9zll65k0t0w"></a>__Why This Is Becoming Part of the Job__

There’s already data showing that expectations for researchers are shifting\. In [an analysis of nearly 3,000 user research job postings](https://depth.drillbitlabs.com/p/how-ai-is-changing-user-research), mentions of AI more than doubled in a year, from 9\.5% in 2024 to 16\.4% in early 2025\. That might sound like a niche change, but it's a strong signal that the shape of the role is evolving\.

That’s especially true on the agency side\.

Clients don’t just want findings\. They want outputs\. They want solid answers\. Sharp insight that gives the client confidence to pull the trigger on change\. It needs to be clear enough to repeat to someone who wasn’t in the room and strong enough to stand up when the room pushes back\.

With AI now able to summarise, cluster, and even write, the value has started to shift\.  It’s now about how clearly it’s interpreted and how easily it can be used\.

And that creates a quiet tension\.

Many researchers are already using tools like ChatGPT, Notion AI, or Aida to speed up the process\. They’re drafting toplines faster, getting clearer sooner\. But that work rarely gets recognised\. And there’s no space to practise or improve\.

Which brings us back to delivery\.

The researchers who can make their insight land clearly, confidently and quickly are already doing work most teams don’t yet know how to do\.

But they will need to \- soon\. 

This is the part of the job that’s getting harder to ignore\.

### <a id="_heading=h.i0x8tb7315ph"></a>__The Researcher’s Expanding Identity__

This shift isn’t just about how we communicate\. It’s about who we are expected to be\.

Researchers are no longer working in isolation from the rest of the business\. They’re being pulled closer to the product\. Closer to product, innovation, and AI\.  And with that comes a quiet evolution of the role\.

You’re not just being asked to uncover insight\. You’re being asked to help shape strategy\. To support decisions\. To get people aligned enough and confident enough to act\.

And in that environment, the ability to *deliver* research is just as critical as the ability to gather and crunch it well\.

That doesn’t mean putting on a performance\. It means learning how to show up with the same clarity, confidence, and relevance that sales and marketing people have spent decades refining, but without losing what makes your voice distinct\.

Because AI can speed up the process, but it can’t read the room\. It can’t sense hesitation or navigate tension\. It can’t help a client understand what’s at stake\.

Only you can do that\.

So no, you don’t need to become a salesperson\. But you do need to become more deliberate about how you make your work land\.

Not just what it says\.  
But what it *does*\.

### <a id="_heading=h.msnygc5ee6gq"></a>__So, Where Does That Leave Us?__

If this all feels familiar, it’s probably because you’ve already been doing it\.  
 Just without calling it “delivery\.”

Adapting in the moment\. Reframing findings to match the room\. Thinking carefully about what someone really needs to hear, not just what was said\.

But for many researchers, this part of the job isn’t formalised\. It’s not in the training\. It’s rarely in the brief\. It quietly becomes part of the role\. And often, part of the pressure\.

If you want to explore this further, and maybe even steal some tricks of the trade,  there’s a companion piece that looks at what it really means to make research persuasive and actionable in practice: [*How to Make Research More Persuasive & Actionable for Stakeholders*](https://beings.com/make-research-more-persuasive/)*\.*

And if any of this rings true for you, or not at all, I’d love to hear your thoughts\. Feel free to reply or leave a comment\.

It’s tempting to focus on the findings and forget that what happens next often depends on how they’re shared\. If we want our work to make a difference, that part deserves just as much care\.
