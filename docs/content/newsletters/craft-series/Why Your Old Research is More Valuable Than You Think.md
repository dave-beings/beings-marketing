# <a id="_b3wz7dgjb001"></a>Why Your Old Research is More Valuable Than You Think

<a id="_czcq89xy1g8d"></a>__*The Stuff We Never Go Back To Could Be Our Edge*__

I’ve worked with research teams for long enough to know the pattern\. A project comes in, everyone’s all over it, designing the guide, fielding, analysing, getting the deck together\. There’s a sense of urgency, sharp focus, a bit of stress if the timeline’s tight, and then… it’s done\. The report goes out, maybe there’s a follow\-up workshop, and then the whole thing gets zipped into a folder and left there\. Everyone moves on\.

And I get it\. Researchers are busy\. There’s always something new coming down the pipeline\. Clients don’t usually ask what you did for them three years ago; they want answers __now__\. 

It’s not that people don’t care about the work; it’s that the system isn’t really set up to revisit it\. 

Most agencies I know don’t have a great way to go back through their own archives\. Some don’t even know where the final reports are stored\. Once the immediate need is met, the rest is history… literally\. I’ve seen it described as [corporate amnesia](https://paulitaylor.com/2024/05/31/institutional-forgetting-and-the-failure-of-corporate-memory)\.

But here’s what’s been playing on my mind lately: what if we’ve been worrying about the wrong thing with AI? Everyone’s focused on what it might take away,  the analysis, the writing, the craft\. But what if the real missed opportunity isn’t about what AI might do *next*, but what it can help us make use of *again*? All that old work, just sitting there, and most people probably aren’t using it… including your competitors\.

## <a id="_s2xukj1z36ny"></a>__There’s Value in That Archive, I Promise__

I had a conversation recently with someone on the team about where AI is going to make the biggest difference in research, and it wasn’t about speed or automation or any of the usual things people fixate on\. 

We ended up talking about the real advantage that large agencies like Ipsos already have\. This is not because they’re using better tools per se, but because they’ve built systems that can surface and connect everything they’ve ever worked on\. That means every study, every debrief, every fragment of knowledge is potentially available, not just for reference, but for analysis across projects, across sectors, across time\.

That kind of capability sounds ambitious if you’re a small or mid\-sized agency, but the foundations for it are already sitting inside most teams\. Years of client work, recurring sectors, frameworks that get adapted and reused, and learnings that show up again and again even if no one has formally linked them together\. It might not be polished or organised yet, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t valuable\. The difference is that bigger agencies have invested in making that archive visible and usable, while smaller ones often treat past work as finished the moment it’s delivered\.

If you’ve been around long enough to have repeat clients or a backlog of proposals, reports, or discussion guides, you already have the raw material to build something useful, not just as a way to work faster, but as a way to think better\. You don’t need thousands of studies to start seeing patterns or drawing on past knowledge\. You need access to what’s already yours, in a format that makes it easy to search, compare, and build from\. That’s what this next phase of AI could support, not replacing researchers, but making the knowledge they’ve already generated easier to tap into\.

The value isn’t just in having the data but by having a way to recognise it as something living, not historical\. It’s something that gets stronger every time you add to it\. And if you’ve got that, even in a basic form, you’re already further ahead than you think\.

So if the value is there, the next step is making it usable\. That starts with shifting how you see your old research\. It’s not clutter\. It’s not dead weight\. It’s something you can build on, reference, and learn from but only if you can actually find it\.   
  
For most teams, that means centralising what you already have, not in theory, not as a wishlist project, but as a first practical move\. Whether it’s a shared folder, a Notion board, or a proper platform, the point is to bring everything into one place where it’s accessible to more than just the person who ran the project\. It doesn’t have to be perfect\. It just has to be somewhere people actually look\. When insights live everywhere, they end up not helping anyone\. A [unified archive](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-build-an-ai-driven-user-research-repository-e38a69a433a3) changes that\.

Once it’s all in one place, the next step is structure\. That might mean tagging by sector, method, audience, or theme\. It might mean flagging standout quotes or noting whether raw data is available\. However you do it, the goal is to make future you \(or someone else on the team\) able to scan a list and immediately know what’s useful\.

You can start small\. Ten good projects tagged properly are more valuable than a hundred that are hard to navigate\. The trick is to treat your old research like it’s something worth investing in, because it is\.

We’re working on a new way of thinking about this, one that focuses on building a personal corpus, a project corpus, and eventually an institutional corpus\. That’s coming in September, and we’ll share more soon\. For now, it’s worth asking yourself: if someone joined your team tomorrow, how easy would it be for them to learn from what’s already been done? If the answer is not very, that’s your signal to start\.

## <a id="_6qgvihbzsig7"></a>__What Happens When You Train Your AI on It__

Once you’ve started building that foundation, things get more interesting\. AI isn’t just there to summarise the latest research, it can start to connect the dots across everything that’s come before\. You can upload proposals, debriefs, interview transcripts, desk research, even internal conversations or notes from a meeting, and Aida won’t just respond to each one in isolation\. She starts to build a picture of how you work as an agency\.

Every time you add something, you’re giving it more context\. The kids might call it “lore”, the stories, habits, and ways of thinking that define who you are and how you operate\. That includes your tone of voice, the types of frameworks you use, the sectors you know well, the way your team thinks about timeframes, themes and tensions\. It’s like creating a second brain that remembers everything, never needs a file path, and actually learns over time\.

This is all about building something that makes every project sharper, more informed, and more connected to the work you’ve already done\. Before you start looking for the next big thing, feed it what you already have\. You’ve probably got more than enough to start building something really useful\.
