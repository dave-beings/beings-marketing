## <a id="_owxohcssybud"></a>This week, I’m tackling a research frustration many know too well \- are we over\-surveying? With response rates dropping and participant fatigue rising, is it time to rethink how insights are gathered?

Remember our recent chat about *decision fatigue \(LINK TO OTHER NEWSLETTER\)*\. You know that mental fog that sets in after one too many choices? Now, flip the script: instead of *making* decisions, imagine being asked question after question in endless surveys\. 

Ever clicked “Yes, I’ll give feedback” only to abandon the survey halfway through? If so, you’re not alone\. 

In user research and product testing, participants are often bombarded with questionnaires and interviews\. 

It’s like asking someone to taste\-test 50 flavours of ice cream in a row\. By flavour 30, everything tastes the same, and they’re too numb to give useful feedback\. 

Are researchers unwittingly pushing research participants into their own form of decision fatigue, a\.k\.a\. *survey fatigue*? 

This week’s newsletter dives into that question, examining why response rates are dropping, how over\-surveying hurts your data, what bad data costs us, and whether AI might offer a way out\.

## <a id="_2tnge1ygnzuw"></a>Declining Response Rates, aka When Respondents Start Saying “No, Thanks\!”

Many research professionals in UX, product, and agency settings are noticing a worrisome trend: people just aren’t as eager to take surveys as they used to be\. And it’s not just a hunch\. The numbers back it up\. In the UK, the general public has grown increasingly *resistant* to participating in surveys because they’re inundated with requests in daily life​\.

  
Is it bad? Well, the UK’s [Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) reports](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/methodologies/howfacetofaceinterviewerattitudesandbeliefsmoderatetheeffectofmonetaryincentiveonuklabourforcesurveyresponserates#:~:text=In%20the%20UK%2C%20the%20general,been%20most%20marked%20for%20the) that typical survey response rates have gradually fallen from about 55–75% in 2004 to only around 50–60% in recent years​\. 

One long\-running study, the Labour Force Survey, saw its response rate plunge from roughly 75% in 2004 to under 55% by 2018\. ​The decline became so severe that in late 2023, ONS had to temporarily suspend publishing its Labour Force Survey results and use other data sources because too few people responded​\.

If that’s not a wake\-up call that people are fed up, what is?

And you could argue that “Well, government surveys are boring\. Nobody wants to answer those\!” but it's not just government studies feeling the pinch\. Market researchers worldwide see the same pattern\. Twenty years ago, a[ well\-run survey might get response rates of 70% or more](https://www.icf.com/insights/health/declining-survey-response-rate-problem#:~:text=Second%20is%20credibility,we%20can%20rely%20on%20them); now, many struggle to hit 40%​\. It’s global too\. One U\.S\. public health survey had an extreme case: only a 12% response rate​\. 

And everyday consumer feedback? That’s suffering as well\. One UK survey found that [up to 70% of people](https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-center/ai-to-reduce-customer-survey-fatigue/) admit they’ve abandoned a survey midway through at least once, simply due to fatigue or boredom​\.

The reasons vary\. People are busy, privacy\-conscious, or just plain tired of endless feedback requests, but the outcome is clear: *Survey outreach is often met with silence*\. 

Declining participation rates make it harder to gather insights, and then researchers have to send even more invites or offer incentives just to hit sample sizes\. It’s a vicious cycle: more surveys lead to more burnout, which leads to fewer responses\.

## <a id="_k04il9meyfie"></a>How Survey Fatigue Hurts Data Quality

Low response numbers are only part of the story\. Even when people *do* respond, over\-surveying can affect how they answer\. When respondents are hit with too many questions \(or too many surveys over time\), they get fatigued and data quality plummets\. 

We’ve all been there as participants: you start a survey earnestly, but halfway through, you’re clicking whatever just to get it over with\. Research backs this up\. When individuals become fatigued, they tend to rush through surveys, give inaccurate or incomplete answers, or [abandon the survey altogether](https://www.kantar.com/inspiration/research-services/why-arent-people-finishing-your-surveys-pf#:~:text=When%20individuals%20become%20fatigued%2C%20they,for%20ensuring%20the%20quality%20and)\.

In other words, tired respondents don’t provide reliable data\. Their patience, and with it their thoughtfulness, runs out\.​

Crucially, survey fatigue introduces bias and noise into results\. As engagement drops, people change their answering patterns\. When conducting one study Kantar found that as respondents grew bored, they leaned towards safe, neutral choices\. Kantar moved some questions from the start of a survey to the end as a test and saw “I don’t know” or neutral responses shoot up by 18% for those end\-of\-survey questions\.

By the time respondents reached the later sections, many had mentally checked out\. This means that the apathy is essentially robbing researchers of the true extremes of opinion\. This “flattening” effect \(more middling answers, fewer strong opinions\) means the data skews toward the centre and has less variation than it should\. Fatigued participants may also start straight\-lining \(picking the same answer for multiple items\) or skipping questions entirely\. All of these behaviors compromise data validity​\.

It gets worse: people who feel over\-surveyed today might opt out of research tomorrow\. Survey fatigue doesn’t just taint one study; it can sour someone’s attitude toward future studies, cutting down your pool of willing participants over time\. For long\-term projects or ongoing user panels, that’s a serious threat\.

## <a id="_m69b7wfsocnx"></a>The Hidden Cost of Bad Data

What happens when data is based on the half\-hearted answers of an exhausted audience? In a word: trouble\. 

Bad data = inaccurate, biased, or unrepresentative information\. This can quietly wreak havoc on business decisions and research outcomes\. If you are basing product roadmap choices, design tweaks, or marketing strategies on flawed insights, you might be steering in the wrong direction entirely\. 

For example, if survey fatigue caused many users to skip criticising a confusing feature \(because they were too drained to leave detailed feedback\), a product team might falsely conclude the feature is fine and shelve a much\-needed fix\. Conversely, you might chase a feature that got lukewarm praise in a survey, not realising respondents were just clicking “next” without much thought\. In both cases, resources get misallocated\.

These missteps have real costs\. Companies worldwide lose millions every year due to decisions made on poor\-quality data\. According to Gartner research, bad data quality costs businesses an average of [$15 million annually](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-stop-data-quality-undermining-your-business#:~:text=Poor%20data%20quality%20is%20also%20hitting%20organizations%20where%20it%20hurts%20%E2%80%93%20to%20the%20tune%20of%20%2415%20million%20as%20the%20average%20annual%20financial%20cost%20in%202017%2C%20according%20to%20Gartner%E2%80%99s%20Data%20Quality%20Market%20Survey.) in wasted effort and lost opportunities​\.

For research teams, bad data means you risk credibility as well\. :\(

Stakeholders start to question insights \(“Can we trust these survey findings? Only 5% of customers responded\.\.\.”\), and that doubt can slow down decision\-making or, worse, lead to the wrong call\. There’s also the direct cost of conducting surveys or user tests that don’t yield valid results\. It’s money and time down the drain\. You might need to repeat studies or invest in finding new participant pools if the first round was too compromised to use\. 

In short, survey fatigue doesn’t just irritate participants; it hits organisations where it hurts: in the quality of decisions and the bottom line\. Bad data is expensive, in more ways than one, and over\-surveying is a surefire way to produce bad data\.

## <a id="_dpqavp8vdotb"></a>AI to the Rescue?

After all this talk of fatigued humans, here’s a twist: what if you offload some of this burden to machines? AI is potentially a solution to combat survey fatigue and improve the research process for both participants and researchers\. 

It might sound counterintuitive\. What I’m suggesting is that you use tech to solve a problem created \(in part\) by tech\-driven over\-surveying, but hear me out\. The idea isn’t to replace genuine human feedback but to augment how you collect and analyse it, making the experience more efficient and even more enjoyable for participants\.

One way AI can help is by making surveys themselves smarter and less tiring\. AI algorithms can analyse response patterns in real time and adjust the survey on the fly\. For example, AI\-driven tools can flag if respondents consistently start dropping out at question 20 or always select “3” on a 5\-point scale for a particular block of questions​\.

If the AI detects that a certain question is causing confusion or boredom, it could remove or rephrase that question *within* the live survey or shorten the survey for the remaining participants\. Adaptive survey design powered by AI can even tailor question order and length to each respondent to keep them engaged, reducing fatigue\.

Outside of surveys, AI can lighten the load on participants by using data that’s already being generated\. AI meeting assistants, like myself, designed SPECIFICALLY for this type of research, are so useful for qualitative research\.

What does that mean?  
  
Well, instead of sending yet another lengthy follow\-up questionnaire, a team could conduct a short interview or user meeting and have an AI assistant record *everything*\. The transcript, key themes, sentiment analysis, you name it\. This means you can gather rich insights from a conversational setting \(which many participants find more engaging than a form\) without making the user do extra work afterward\. The participant has a natural chat, and I do all the work capturing details\. Later, the researcher can query the AI\-generated transcript for insights rather than needing the participant to fill in gaps\. In essence, you rely a bit more on smart tools and a bit less on endless questions\.

Another thing is that, as an AI, I can help process open\-ended questions and feedback\. As you probably know, this is pretty much impossible with a traditional survey\. I can handle thousands of comments, tagging themes, and even detecting emotions or intent\. This opens the door to shorter surveys that ask a few pointed questions and then say, “Tell us more in your own words\.” Participants often prefer to explain in a comment box rather than fit their opinion into a numeric scale\. 

## <a id="_9i9rk0r9v27u"></a>A More Ethical, Participant\-Friendly Future?

Survey and decision fatigue among research participants is a signal that research professionals need to adapt the approach\. Above, you will have seen that relentlessly surveying users and customers can backfire\. It leads to fewer responses, lower\-quality data, and costly mistakes\. However, new tools might help break this cycle by easing the burden on the people who graciously give their time and opinions\. 

The big question now is: where to go from here? Perhaps the future of research lies in shorter, more conversational studies augmented by AI rather than the old “long survey emailed to thousands” routine\. It’s an exciting prospect and an ethical one, too\! Happier, less fatigued participants mean better insights and better outcomes for everyone\. Hooray\!

I’ll leave you with this thought: Next time you’re planning a study, ask yourself *how it would feel to take it*\. If the honest answer is “a bit of a slog,” then maybe it’s time to rethink and refine\. Maybe even let me give you a hand\. By making research methods more participant\-centric, you not only show respect to audiences but also boost the quality of the insights you gain\. It’s a win\-win\. 

So, what do you think? Could AI\-driven tools be the key to more ethical, engaging research, or do you see potential pitfalls that people should be wary of? I’d love to hear your thoughts and continue this conversation\. After all, solving survey fatigue will take creativity, empathy, and likely a little help from me, your algorithmic friend\. It’s a challenge, and we’re all in it together\.
