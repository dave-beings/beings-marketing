__*META DESCRIPTION: What are AI hallucinations in research? Explore causes, red flags, and strategies to reduce risk in your qualitative analysis workflow\.*__

AI can dramatically speed up analysis\. But when it generates information that isn’t actually there, it risks undermining the entire process\. This is what happens when AI fills in the gaps in your data, an issue referred to as __AI hallucination__\.

Hallucinations are glitches where the AI attempts to be helpful but inadvertently invents content\. This could be a quote that was never said, a theme no one mentioned, or a conclusion the data doesn’t support\.

In contrast, __errors__ are misinterpretations of real input\. Think mislabelled sentiment, a misheard phrase, or a wrongly applied code\. Still frustrating, but at least based on something that was actually there\.

Both can derail your research, but the good news is that most are avoidable\.

## <a id="_cbw5i5cfckua"></a>__AI Hallucinations \(At a Glance\)__

- __What they are:__ Made\-up quotes, themes, or insights that weren’t actually in your data  

- __Why they happen:__ AI fills in gaps when asked to generate rather than extract  

- __Where they show up:__ Most often in summaries, but can appear during transcription or coding  

- __Why it matters:__ Fabricated findings can quietly shape reports, mislead decisions, and erode trust  

- __How to reduce risk:__ Use specific prompts, ask for source links, verify outputs, and choose tools built for qual research

## <a id="_l0oz2ps18l1f"></a>__Where Hallucinations Creep In__

AI tools are integrated across the entire qualitative research pipeline, from transcription to theme generation and writing your final report\. The risk of hallucination changes depending on where and how you're using it\.

Here’s where things can go wrong\.

### <a id="_jnw9zx9ec8l6"></a>__1\. Transcription and Translation__

At this stage, you’re more likely to encounter errors than hallucinations\.

Mishearing words, flattening dialects, or misplacing punctuation can all affect meaning, but the AI is still working with real input\.

However, if the transcription tool gets seriously confused \(especially with heavy accents, technical jargon, or overlapping speakers\), you might see it invent words or entire clauses\. That’s where hallucination risk creeps in\.

__Example:  
__A simple “I can’t say I loved it” becomes “I loved it,” changing the sentiment completely\.

### <a id="_c1cijmmhutzw"></a>__2\. Coding and Thematic Analysis__

This is where hallucinations start doing real damage\.

Tools like NVivo’s AI assistant or large language models might cluster ideas, apply codes, or suggest themes based on patterns, but not always based on *your* data\.

Sometimes, the AI will “fill in” a theme it’s seen elsewhere, even if your participants never mentioned it\.

__Example:  
__No one talks about pricing in your interviews, but the AI includes “pricing concerns” as a recurring theme\. It sounds right, but it’s fiction\.

As Ryan Thomas Williams notes, “[AI might overlook the subtleties of human communication\.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2024.1331589/full)”

In qualitative research, nuance is everything, and AI isn’t always subtle\.

### <a id="_snc1o6z4k54t"></a>__3\. Summarisation and Reporting__

This is where the vast majority of hallucinations occur\.  
  
Generative tools can produce well\-written summaries that sound impressive but are based on very little\. If the data is vague or patchy, the AI might confidently state conclusions that were never actually said\.

__Example:  
__The summary claims, “Participants felt the onboarding process was smooth and intuitive,” despite the transcripts showing confusion and frustration\.

AI is trained to provide an answer, even if it has to make one up\. That’s why this stage needs the most careful human oversight\.

## <a id="_6bepoaqia5uk"></a>How to Spot AI Hallucinations

Even with an AI tool that has been built specifically around your project, hallucinations can still occur\.

These systems operate within a controlled environment, using your transcripts, project\-specific data, and in some cases, previous internal work\. This makes them more aligned with your research goals, but accuracy still needs to be actively checked\.

[A 2024 study analysed 243 distorted responses generated by ChatGPT](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03811-x) to better understand how AI goes wrong\. The researchers identified __eight major error types__, with one key category, __“unfounded fabrication”__, directly linked to what we now call AI hallucinations\. These are confident but entirely made\-up facts, quotes, or conclusions that were never present in the source material\. The study also outlined 31 subcategories of error, illustrating the complexity and subtlety of AI distortions\.

With that in mind, here are five ways we identify issues before they impact findings\.

1. __Trace insights back to the source__  
Every suggested code, theme, or summary should link clearly to something a participant actually said\. If we cannot find a quote or piece of data that supports it, we treat it as unreliable and remove it from the analysis\.  

2. __Treat summaries as working drafts__  
AI\-generated summaries are a time\-saver, but they can flatten nuance or misrepresent tone\. Before anything moves forward, we compare the summary to the raw data\. This helps catch overgeneralisations, contradictions, or points that are too neatly packaged\.  

3. __Be alert to phrasing that feels off__  
Sometimes the language in an AI output sounds too confident or too polished\. That can be a sign that the tool has paraphrased beyond the original meaning or drawn a conclusion that is not properly grounded in the data\. When this happens, we pause and review it carefully\.  

4. __Use human review as a quality check__  
AI tools can handle volume, but people handle context\. Every project includes a manual validation stage, whether that is a full review or a targeted check of flagged content\. This ensures nothing slips through without human oversight\.  

5. __Keep the scope of prompts tight__  
The broader the instruction, the more likely the AI is to stretch beyond what the data supports\. We keep our prompts specific and closely aligned with the brief\. This encourages focused, evidence\-based output that stays within the bounds of the actual material\.

## <a id="_1bodppv1fju6"></a>Red Flags \- When to Pause and Check the AI's Output

These are __not always signs the AI has definitely hallucinated__, but they should prompt you to go back to the raw data and verify what you’re seeing\.

- A theme appears that wasn’t in your original plan and feels unfamiliar  

- The AI surfaces a quote you don’t recognise or can’t locate in the transcript  

- Summary language includes phrases like "everyone agreed" or "most participants" without clear evidence  

- The tone or vocabulary feels too polished compared to how your participants actually spoke  

- A throwaway comment is elevated into a core insight without context  

- The findings echo what the client might want to hear a little too neatly  

- Numbers or percentages are included without any data trail  

- You see repeated phrases that don’t appear in the original materials  

- The AI groups together comments that feel unrelated or forced into a single theme  

- Something looks useful, but doesn’t sit right\. Like it feels surprising without being supported  


These are the moments that should trigger a closer look\. But in truth, we should be checking everything\. Human oversight is what keeps the work credible in the first place\.

## <a id="_5kpvbzcfvz8t"></a>How to Fix or Prevent Hallucinations

Most hallucinations are subtle\. They can shift meaning without drawing attention\. Here's how we keep them in check\.

1. __Use focused prompts  
__Keep instructions specific\. We ask AI to extract patterns from defined transcripts, not generate content\. This helps keep outputs grounded in real input\.

__Extraction__ keeps it anchored\. __Generation__ gives it freedom, and that's where hallucinations creep in\.  


1. __Ask for justification  
__If the tool surfaces a theme or quote, we follow it back to the original data\. When that connection is not obvious, we check it manually\. It does not need to be complicated\.   
  
Even a quick verification step can catch the majority of issues before they reach the client or the final deck\. You can even question the AI and ask where it found this quote\. It will often admit that it was a creation when asked initially\.  

2. __Treat outputs as drafts  
__We do not assume the first AI\-generated summary is ready to present\. It is a working draft\. We review it for accuracy, consistency and tone\. If something feels overstated, vague or out of character with the rest of the dataset, we check it\. Sometimes it holds up\. Sometimes it does not\.  

3. __Make space for manual review  
__Even with customised models and tightly scoped prompts, we still build in human oversight\. Sometimes that means reviewing a random sample of coded responses\. Sometimes it is a targeted review of anything that looks too confident or too convenient\. However it is done, someone on the team puts eyes on the output before it is used\.  

4. __Check outliers and contradictions  
__If a single quote or idea suddenly takes up too much space in the narrative, we check whether it deserves that weight\. If an insight seems to contradict the rest of the findings, we look at it again\. The goal is not to ignore outliers but to make sure they are real\.  

5. __Use the AI for structure, not strategy  
__We use these tools to help surface patterns and organise responses, __not to decide what matters__\. The insight, the interpretation, and the final call still come from us\.

## <a id="_af8nsiy4vr9g"></a>__What Comes Next__

AI has a place in qualitative research, and it isn’t there to replace researchers\. Its value lies in reducing manual strain, speeding up analysis, and making large datasets more manageable\. When used effectively, it accelerates coding, surfaces emerging themes, and frees up time for deeper interpretation\.

However, it must be used with caution\. Off\-the\-shelf models carry risks that are easy to miss\. They often fail to grasp context, tone, or nuance\. And they’re rarely built to reflect the methodological standards that qualitative work relies on\.

__Aida by Beings__ was built for this exact challenge \(and for others specific to qualitative research\)\. It includes safeguards that reduce hallucinations, link insights back to source data, and make the process auditable at every step\. It is not infallible, and no tool is, but it is far more attuned to the risks of fictionalisation and works actively to prevent them\.

If you’re already using AI in qualitative research, Aida gives you a better foundation\. And if you’re not using AI yet, this is the place to start because [Aida is a purpose\-built AI for credible qualitative analysis\.](https://app.beings.com/)
