# How to prompt

##### A Guide to Working with Your AI Research Assistant

### Introduction

To get the most out of Beings, one skill matters above all: **strategic prompting**.

Whether you’re working with Aida—your default Beings assistant—or training a custom research agent of your own, the principle is the same: _clear prompts lead to better insights, faster_.

Beings assistants are built to accelerate your qualitative workflow while preserving depth, nuance, and human judgment. But just like any teammate, they need clear direction.

#### Think of Your Assistant as a Research Teammate

Aida—and any future agent you train—is like a brilliant junior researcher: fast, methodical, and deeply trained in qualitative methods.

What they need is **your brief**: context, clarity, and intent.

### The 4 C’s of Strategic Prompting

Use this framework to consistently generate high-quality, structured responses.

#### 1\. **Context** – Set the Scene

🗯️ Instead of: “Summarise this.”

✅ Try: “This is an interview with a long-term healthcare plan member. We want to uncover what drives their loyalty and any recurring frustrations.”

#### 2\. **Clarity** – Be Specific

🗯️ Instead of: “What are the main themes?”

✅ Try: “List the top five frustrations related to the service process, focusing on communication, claims, and approvals.”

#### 3\. **Constraint** – Guide the Output

🗯️ Instead of: “Highlight quotes.”

✅ Try: “Extract three quotes about ‘brand loyalty vs. Bupa’ and format them in a table with ‘Quote’ and ‘Participant ID’ columns.”

#### 4\. **Converse** – Keep the Dialogue Going

🗯️ Initial prompt: “What frustrations are mentioned?”

✅ Follow-up: “Can you dig into the issue around pre-approvals? What caused that frustration according to the participant?”

### Applying the 4 C’s in Practice

#### Thematic Analysis Across Interviews

**Prompt:**

- \[Context\] “I’m analysing 28 interviews with healthcare plan members.”
- \[Clarity\] “Identify the top 5 recurring pain points and moments of delight.”
- \[Constraint\] “Include three anonymised quotes for each.”

#### 📝 Reviewing a Discussion Guide

**Prompt:**

- \[Context\] “Act as a research methodologist reviewing this guide.”
- \[Clarity\] “Identify any leading or unclear questions.”
- \[Constraint\] “Explain the issue and rewrite each in more neutral terms.”
