## Modern Slavery Policy

**Introduction**

At Beings, we are committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in all our business operations. We recognise that modern slavery, in its various forms, is a global issue that requires collective action. This policy outlines our commitment to preventing and addressing modern slavery within our own operations and supply chains.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all activities undertaken by Beings, including but not limited to:

- The development and maintenance of the Beings website and associated platforms.
- The procurement of goods and services.
- The engagement with suppliers, contractors, and business partners.

**Our Commitment**

We are committed to:

- Complying with all relevant laws and regulations relating to modern slavery in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

- Providing training and support to our employees to help them identify and report any concerns related to modern slavery.
- Regularly reviewing and updating this policy to ensure its effectiveness.

**Due Diligence**

We will conduct due diligence on our suppliers and business partners to assess their commitment to preventing modern slavery. This may include:

- Requiring suppliers to comply with our Modern Slavery Policy.
- Conducting audits and site visits.
- Monitoring suppliers' performance and taking appropriate action in case of non-compliance.

**Whistleblowing**

We encourage all employees, suppliers, and business partners to report any concerns related to modern slavery. We have a whistleblowing policy in place that protects the identity of whistleblowers and ensures that their concerns are investigated promptly and thoroughly.
