## The largest of large problems.

In 2023, I had the opportunity to work with a large search engine’s UX Infrastructure team to tackle a challenge they were facing in their UX labs. Despite their impressive research facilities (over 150 labs globally), they were dealing with outdated AV systems, compliance risks, and a surge in support tickets.

The old AV systems weren't cutting it anymore in the world of hybrid and remote work. The large search engine needed a change to keep up with the evolving nature of their products and services. They wanted to:

- - Conduct more usability research in the real world, not just in labs.

- - Expand their participant pool to include more diverse users.

- - Accelerate their speed to insight by improving research processes.

We worked closely with their UX research teams, to understand their research processeses and leading us to customise our WebApp and revolutionize their research. The researchers even called it "the future of research."

Our WebApp put researchers in control. With multi-camera, multi-device capabilities, they could focus on exactly what they needed. Facial expressions? No problem. Context? Switch cameras. Multiple devices side-by-side? Easy. The intuitive interface empowered researchers to direct their sessions and extract valuable insights.

Inspired by this collaboration, we’ve been exploring how AI could impact the broader research industry.

### Introducing Co-Intelligent Research

We are not called 'Human Doings,' we're called 'Human Beings.' Our unique blend of creativity, drive, and moral awareness elevates us. We seek meaning and purpose. We exist to _be_, not merely to _do_.

That's why we're building Aida, a co-intelligence designed to amplify _your_ expertise. Aida is more than just an AI; she's a co-intelligent researcher who seamlessly integrates with your workflow, understands your context and methods, and orchestrates an ensemble of AIs to surface the most relevant insights.

Imagine this: Aida effortlessly anonymizes your data, sends it to multiple LLMs, and presents you with the key insights that matter most to you.

All the tedious work is taken care of, so you can focus on being the researcher you were meant to be.

With Aida, you're the composer, and she's the conductor, leading an ensemble of AIs to amplify your intelligence.

### The Power of Co-Intelligent Research

We believe AI's true potential in research isn't about replacing humans but about supercharging their capabilities. This is where co-intelligent research comes in.

Co-intelligent research is a dynamic partnership between humans and AI, where each contributes their unique strengths. It's about leveraging AI's computational power and pattern recognition while harnessing human creativity, intuition, and critical thinking.

Imagine AI sifting through mountains of data, uncovering hidden trends and connections. Meanwhile, freed from tedious tasks, researchers can focus on interpreting findings, formulating hypotheses, and designing groundbreaking experiments.

Co-intelligent research amplifies human intelligence, creating a harmonious partnership where humans and AI push the boundaries of knowledge and understanding.

### Principles of Co-Intelligent Research

Co-intelligent research is a shift in how we approach discovery. It's anchored in these key pillars:

- - **Human-AI Partnership:** AI processes information, but human researchers bring the spark of intuition, creativity, and ethical awareness. Aida empowers this collaboration, not replaces it.

- - **Transparency and Explainability:** AI systems should be transparent in how they work. Researchers should understand how Aida arrives at her insights, ensuring trust and accountability.

- - **Emotional Intelligence & Ethical Considerations:** Co-intelligent research analyzes data and understands the human stories within. Aida is sensitive to emotional nuances, ensuring research is both insightful and ethical.

- - **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** Both humans and AI should be open to continuous learning and adaptation. Aida evolves alongside you, refining her assistance based on your feedback.

- - **Focused Attention & Strategic Thinking:** Aida helps filter noise, prioritize information, and enable strategic decision-making, allowing researchers to maintain focus and engage in higher-order thinking.

These principles ensure that co-intelligent research is not just powerful, but responsible and empowering.

### Applications of Co-Intelligent Research

Co-intelligent research is revolutionizing research across various fields:

- - **Qualitative Research:** Aida transcribes and summarizes interviews and focus groups, highlighting key themes and sentiments. She streamlines the analysis of observational data, identifying patterns and potential usability issues.

- - **Quantitative Research:** Aida processes vast datasets, identifies statistical trends, visualizes data, and assists in hypothesis generation.

- - **Across Industries:** From technology and healthcare to finance and retail, Aida helps researchers make data-driven decisions, uncover critical insights, and improve products and services.

No matter your research methodology, industry, or organization size, Aida is your co-intelligent partner, amplifying your expertise and enabling you to achieve more impactful research outcomes.
