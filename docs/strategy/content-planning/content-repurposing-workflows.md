# Content Repurposing Workflows

*Systematic processes to maximize content value across podcasts ‚Üí blog ‚Üí newsletter ‚Üí social ‚Üí video channels*

## Overview

**Goal**: Transform each piece of core content into 10-15 assets across multiple channels  
**Efficiency**: Create once, distribute everywhere with channel-specific optimization  
**ROI**: Maximize reach and engagement from existing high-quality content  
**Consistency**: Maintain a consistent brand voice and messaging for our target personas  

---

## Guiding Principles

All content repurposing efforts should be guided by our core brand and audience principles:

- **Brand Voice**: **Insightful, Direct, Empowering**. Every asset should feel like it's from an expert partner, not a generic tool. We use the language of "co-intelligence" to elevate, not replace, the researcher.
- **Primary Persona**: **"Agency Alex" (The Agency Decision-Maker)**. Every asset should address her core pain points: client pressure, operational efficiency, and competitive differentiation. The goal is to make her feel smarter and more capable of growing her business.

## Master Content Repurposing Workflow

### **Closing the Loop: Monthly Content Review**

Data is only useful when it informs action. This process ensures we continuously improve.

#### **Process**:
- **Timeline**: First Friday of every month.
- **Attendees**: Content Creator, Social Media Manager, Dave.
- **Agenda**:
    1.  **Review Top & Bottom Performers (30 mins)**:
        - Which blog post drove the most newsletter sign-ups?
        - Which newsletter had the highest open and click-through rates?
        - Which social media posts got the most engagement (comments, shares)?
        - Which podcast topic led to the most discussion?
        - What failed? What got no traction?
    2.  **Identify Patterns & Hypotheses (15 mins)**:
        - "It seems like content focused on 'operational efficiency' (like the Manual Work Audit) resonates more than abstract 'thought leadership'."
        - "Our carousels on LinkedIn are getting high engagement, but the polls are not."
        - "Podcast clips featuring guests talking about client management get more views."
    3.  **Actionable Next Steps (15 mins)**:
        - **Double down**: "Let's create a follow-up blog post on '5 Ways to Reduce Manual Work in a Research Agency'."
        - **Repurpose a winner**: "Let's turn the 'Manual Work Audit' post into a short video tutorial."
        - **Experiment**: "Let's pause polls for a month and try a text-with-image format on Thursdays instead."
        - **Inform future content**: "For next month's content, let's focus the theme on 'Client & Project Management'."

#### **Goal**:
To move from a "create and publish" mindset to a "publish, analyze, and iterate" loop. This ensures our content strategy becomes smarter and more effective over time, consistently delivering value to "Agency Alex".
