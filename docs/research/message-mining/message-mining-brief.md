## Overview

Message mining is a research technique that helps you understand your target audience better and create messaging that resonates using information freely available online.

## Process Steps

### 1. Identify Jobs-to-be-Done
- Think about the jobs-to-be-done (problems to solve, opportunities, goals) your target customers have

### 2. Research Information Sources
Look for what is being said around these jobs to be done in:
- **Online reviews** of alternative solutions that satisfy this need
- **Competitor messaging** (website, socials, emails, ads)
- **LinkedIn posts/groups** your target customers are in
- **Voice of Customer (VoC) data** - take note of key phrases people are using

### 3. Apply Language Patterns
- Use similar words and phrases in your own messaging

## Voice of Customer (VoC) Database Structure

Organize data using these categories:

### Core Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Scenario** | Specific situation the user is in to help better understand the personas |
| **Pains/Push** | Problems people face that make them seek solutions, or pains they face with an existing solution |
| **Goals/Jobs** | The end goal they are trying to achieve, often using a verb which can be rephrased by starting it with the phrase "I want to" |
| **Pull of Solutions** | Positive attributes of a solution they are looking for |
| **Anxieties** | Fears or doubts people have about solutions to their problems |
| **Inertia** | Habits or beliefs about the way they currently do things that make it hard to change |

## Topic Grouping Process

### Initial Categorization
- Add a topic to each quote
- Start with lots of topics initially

### Pattern Recognition
- Eventually patterns will emerge
- Combine topics that at first seem different but are actually the same
- **Target**: Aim for about 15-20 final topics

## Quantitative Analysis

### Frequency Tracking
- Once you have enough data, track what topics are coming up more often than others
- Use frequency as an indication of what is more important to users
- Prioritize messaging based on topic importance

## Message Development Strategy

### Language Market Fit
With a clear idea of how our audience talks about what they are trying to achieve and the criteria influencing their decision around solutions, we will be able to:

1. **Use their own language** to create messaging that resonates with what's already in their minds
2. **Create recognition** - whenever they read about Beings they will think "this is EXACTLY what I'm looking for"
3. **Cut through curiosity to value comprehension** and increase conversion
4. **Achieve language market fit** - messaging that speaks directly to user mental models

### Expected Outcome
Messages that immediately resonate because they use the exact language and concepts already present in the target audience's mind, creating instant recognition and understanding.

## Implementation Notes

This methodology focuses on discovering and leveraging the natural language patterns that target customers already use when discussing their needs, challenges, and desired solutions. By mirroring this language in marketing messaging, Beings can achieve better message-market fit and higher conversion rates.
