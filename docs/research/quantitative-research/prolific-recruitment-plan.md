Main study

N = 12

We will then create the main study and recruit using a Custom allow list. This enables us to enter the Prolific IDs of the participants who passed the screening questions in the first survey. Only these participants will be able to take part in this study. They will automatically be emailed with an invitation to take part within one hour of the study being published.
