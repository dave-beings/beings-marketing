## Customer Quote

> "I think the psychometric analysis (or whatever it's called) that we got out of the last analysis you did for us was really interesting and provocative in terms of getting to a layer beneath the surface answers people gave. Obviously, in the wrong hands it can be misinterpreted or not properly understood, but it was like having our own little psychiatrist in the house. There's something in helping the research industry better understand (and appreciate) what might be going on behind the answers people can give ‚Äì and giving the industry better access to that kind of understanding."
