## Executive Summary

This interview captures valuable customer feedback from Quadrangle's use of Beings' ADA platform for a strategic positioning project. Ben provides detailed insights on how ADA helped structure unstructured research data, enabled solo project delivery during resource constraints, and facilitated strategic thinking by handling operational synthesis tasks.

## Key Insights & Value Propositions Validated

### ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Value: Structure from Chaos**
- ADA transformed unstructured research conversations into organized, actionable insights
- Provided "phenomenal" help in structuring feedback for client presentation
- Enabled helicopter view synthesis (e.g., customer journey mapping) that would be nearly impossible manually

### âš¡ **Productivity & Resource Efficiency**  
- Allowed solo delivery of 35+ consultation synthesis during peak season
- Prevented need for additional team members during busy Christmas period
- Freed up strategic thinking time by handling operational synthesis

### ðŸ§  **Strategic Enablement**
- Ben: "I was able to spend time thinking about strategy because I didn't have to sweat so much about the inputs"
- Positioned as "co-intelligent" tool - handles operational/tactical, humans focus on strategy
- Quality equivalent to 4-5 years research experience level

### ðŸ’° **Commercial Success**
- Client feedback: "really, really good, really well structured, really clear, easy to follow, and commercially focused"
- Project led to additional engagement opportunities
- Ben described it as "probably the most strategic presentation I've done for quite some time"

## Pricing Intelligence

- **Target Price Point:** Â£250/month per user (Â£3k/year)
- **Model Preference:** Consumption-based with credits for uploaded content
- **Project-Based Approach:** Preferred over monthly subscriptions
- **Ben's Response:** "I'll buy your hand off for that"

## Product Development Insights

### Feature Requests
1. **Word clouds and semi-quantification tools**
2. **Quote extraction and compilation features** - "find me some quotes that bring this to life"
3. **Microsoft Word integration/export**
4. **Project-level data retention controls**

### Positioning Strategy
- **"Co-intelligent"** rather than "AI assistant" or "co-pilot"
- Focus on operational efficiency, not strategic replacement
- Emphasize structure and organization capabilities
- Target senior research managers (4-5 years experience level)

## Competitive Advantages Identified

1. **Memory and Connection Power** - "it is less about the rate of knots, it's more the power of storing and memory and connections"
2. **Personal Training Capability** - learns individual briefing style and approach
3. **End-to-End Process Support** - discovery through synthesis to presentation
4. **Compliance and Data Management** - built-in project lifecycle controls

## Market Insights

### Industry Challenges
- Research industry has "one of the most inefficient production lines in the world"
- Productivity pressure across agencies
- Resource constraints during peak periods
- Need for AI adoption to remain competitive

### Adoption Barriers
- Internal resistance to AI tools
- Concerns about losing human insight ("dog that isn't barking")
- Compliance and disclosure requirements
- Need for proper training and briefing
