## Key Differentiators

### 1. **Hybrid Fusion Engine**
**What it is**: Proprietary technology that combines keyword, semantic, and graph-based analysis to find signals other tools miss
**Why it matters**: Ensures every pattern Aida uncovers is precise, context-aware, and fully traceable, allowing researchers to trust the output
**Proof point**: Google partnership validation, superior accuracy vs. single-method approaches

### 2. **Personalization Loop (Learning to Rank)**
**What it is**: Custom models that learn from every user interaction, click, and edit to adapt Aida's analysis to your unique style
**Why it matters**: Creates a powerful network effect and makes the platform indispensableâ€”the more you use it, the more it thinks like you
**Proof point**: Defensible moat that competitors can't replicate, validated through customer interviews on "contextualized AI assistant" needs

### 3. **Co-Intelligence Architecture**
**What it is**: Platform designed for graceful degradation and full observability, keeping researchers in control while amplifying their thinking
**Why it matters**: Addresses liability concerns and skill development fearsâ€”enhances rather than replaces human expertise
**Proof point**: Customer feedback: "AI as sparring partner," addresses #1 adoption blocker (fear of losing research skills)
