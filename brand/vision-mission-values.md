## Why Beings is a Winning Team

Change starts with understanding people. 

Our journey began through a collaboration with Google. They asked the Beings team to redefine the future of research. So, we transformed how over 1,500 researchers engage with and understand real people. 

The Beings team builds empathetic AI video technology - driven by an unstoppable hunger to help people understand each other in order to make better decisions. 

We are fascinated by the human condition - why people do what they do. This spirit of inquiry remains our competitive fire, as we uncover what customers want but cannot yet articulate. We shape change rather than bend to it, guided by understanding.

The Beings team has an audacious vision - to have 1 in 10 of the Global 2000 use our human insights platform, by 2030, to improve their customer experiences. Companies that get closer to their customers' experiences will be the ones that thrive. We're on a mission to make understanding people simpler and richer than ever.

Technology at Beings isn't just about algorithms and data; it's about forging shared understanding and empathy between people. We turn disconnected data points into useful insights, uplifting everyone involved. Our commitment to progress powered by humanity is unwavering. This ethos is what makes us an unquestionably winning team – we're not just creating technology; we're humanising the way the world connects.

**If technology lacks empathy, progress lacks meaning.**
