## Beings

# Overview

Old: 

Beings is an AI-powered, human-led \[ qualitative \] research platform, designed to help you deliver business impact quickly without compromising on depth or quality.

New: 

Beings is the co-intelligence platform for qualitative research. We pair expert researchers with a smart, adaptive AI partner to uncover validated insights with unprecedented speed and depth.

## What is it?

Old: 

Beings is an end-to-end research platform which uses AI to transform the way qualitative data is captured, processed and used. 

With a focus on preserving depth, quality and accuracy, Beings is designed to elevate how people who do research spend their time in order to accelerate the impact of their work.

New: 

Beings is an end-to-end research platform engineered to master the complexity of qualitative data.

We go beyond simple automation. Our platform is built on a sophisticated hybrid data engine, fusing keyword, semantic, and graph-based analysis to find signals that other tools miss. This ensures every pattern Aida uncovers is precise, context-aware, and fully traceable, allowing researchers to trust the output and focus their time on strategic interpretation.

## How does it work?

Old:

Meet Aida, your dedicated research assistant, designed and specifically trained to:

1 ) Automate up to 80% of the research workflow, removing the tedious manual tasks so you can focus on the deeper analysis and strategic thinking.

2\) Work alongside you to uncover patterns across vast quantities of data, all through the lens of your own context, style and preferences.

New:

You work in partnership with Aida, your dedicated research co-pilot. Unlike generic assistants, Aida is designed to become your intellectual partner.

1. Accelerate the Workflow, Amplify Your Thinking: Aida automates the tedious manual labour of research (transcription, coding, summarization) but keeps you in control. Our architecture is designed for graceful degradation and full observability, ensuring the system is reliable and you can always trace an insight back to its source.  
2. Evolve from Assistant to Partner: Aida's real power is its ability to learn from you. Every interaction, click, and edit is a "teaching event" that refines her understanding. Our proprietary Learning to Rank (LTR) models use this feedback to adapt Aida's analysis to your unique context, style, and priorities. The more you use Beings, the more it thinks like youâ€”transforming it from a tool into a personalized, defensible asset for your team.

## 5 Pillars

Old: 

1: Strengthen \- Improve decision-making and build stronger stakeholder relationships.

2: Scale \- Expand research capabilities across larger datasets and multiple regions.

3: Speed \- Automate and accelerate tasks to enhance efficiency and productivity.

4: Safety \- Ensure data privacy and ethical standards are maintained.

5: Satisfaction \- Make research tasks more enjoyable and deliver richer insights.

New:

1: Deeper Insights (was Strengthen):

Move beyond surface-level patterns. Our hybrid engine connects concepts across your entire dataset, revealing multi-hop insights and "unknown unknowns" that are impossible to find manually. Every finding is backed by traceable, verifiable data, strengthening the credibility of your recommendations.

2: Scalable Knowledge (was Scale):

Expand your research capacity without expanding your team. Analyze vast, multi-region datasets with the same rigour as a small-scale study, ensuring consistent quality and depth across your entire knowledge base.

3: Unrivaled Speed (was Speed):

Reduce the research lifecycle from months to days. By automating tedious manual work and accelerating the analysis phase, your team can deliver strategic insights at the speed the business demands.

4: Enterprise-Grade Trust (was Safety):

Built on a "Buy and Build" philosophy, we leverage best-of-breed, fully compliant vendors (for SOC II, GDPR, HIPAA) for commodity infrastructure. This allows us to focus our engineering on proprietary IP while ensuring your data is handled with uncompromising security and privacy.

5: The Joy of Research (was Satisfaction):

Refocus your energy on what you love: strategic thinking, uncovering human stories, and driving business impact. We handle the grunt work, making the research process more creative, insightful, and enjoyable.

## One Minute Pitch

Old:

Beings is developing an AI-powered qualitative research platform to help researchers uncover deeper insights faster and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

We operate in the rapidly growing marketing technology market, currently valued at $325 billion and projected to grow at a 21% CAGR.

We are similar to Remesh and Discuss, but we differentiate ourselves by seamlessly integrating AI throughout the entire research process, from recruitment and analysis to reporting, while prioritising human expertise and ethical considerations.

Currently, we have a product in the market that was co-created with the research team at Google, and we are actively seeking user feedback to further refine and enhance its capabilities.

We are looking for seed funding to accelerate our product development, expand our team, and bring Beings to market, empowering researchers to unlock the full potential of their qualitative data.

New:

Beings is building the definitive co-intelligence platform for the $325B MarTech market, enabling enterprise research teams to uncover validated insights with unprecedented speed and depth.

While competitors like Remesh and Discuss.io focus on specific stages of the research process, Beings provides an end-to-end, learning system. Our differentiation is not just slapping AI on top of a workflow; it is our proprietary Hybrid Fusion Engine, which combines keyword, vector, and graph search for superior accuracy.

Our long-term, defensible moat is our personalization loop. The platform learns from every user interaction, training custom models that make our AI co-pilot, Aida, progressively smarter and more attuned to each researcher's unique context. This creates a powerful network effect and makes the platform indispensable.

We have validated our approach with the research team at Google and are now seeking seed funding. We have a capital-efficient "Buy and Build" strategy, allowing us to focus investment on our proprietary IP. This funding will be used to scale our engineering team, accelerate the development of our personalization engine, and bring Beings to market.
