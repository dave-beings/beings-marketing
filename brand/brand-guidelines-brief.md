## Beings

**1\. Project Overview**  
 Beings is committed to maintaining a consistent and engaging user experience across our digital platforms. In alignment with our core UX focus, this project is not about reinventing our brand, but rather formalizing and refreshing our visual identity. We require a comprehensive Brand & Style Guidelines document and a set of design templates—including a slide deck and social media collateral—that capture our existing identity while adding clarity and consistency to our communications.

**2\. Objectives**

* **Guidelines Document:** Develop a detailed brand and style guidelines document that defines typography, color palettes, logo usage, imagery, and layout standards.

* **Templates:** Create a master slide deck template for presentations and additional templates for social media posts (and optionally other collateral) to ensure a consistent look and feel across channels.


**3\. Scope of Work**

* **Brand Guidelines:**

  * Develop comprehensive guidelines covering color palettes, typography, iconography, imagery, and overall layout.

  * Ensure the guidelines support accessibility and are in line with Beings’ core UX principles.

* **Slide Deck Template:**

  * Design a flexible and visually engaging slide deck template suitable for both internal and external presentations.

  * Include customizable elements for titles, content slides, charts, and visual data representation.

* **Social Media & Additional Templates:**

  * Create templates for social media posts that can be adapted for various platforms.

  * Optionally propose additional collateral templates (e.g., email headers, digital ads) if it supports our overall communication strategy.

* **Quote Sourcing:**

  * Each quote should include a detailed breakdown of costs, timelines, and deliverables for the above scope.

**4\. Deliverables**

* A finalized Brand & Style Guidelines document (in PDF and editable format).

* A master slide deck template (Google Slides and/or PowerPoint format).

* A set of social media templates (Figma  files or equivalent, plus web-ready versions).

* A comparative summary of three sourced quotes, including pricing and project timelines.

**5\. Timeline & Process**

* **Proposal Submission:** Interested agencies must submit an initial proposal and detailed quote within 2 weeks.

* **Review & Selection:** Our team will review submissions, comparing design portfolios, project management approaches, and pricing.

* **Project Kickoff:** Once the quote is selected, a project kickoff meeting will define detailed milestones and a final delivery timeline (expected total duration: 4–6 weeks).

* **Draft & Iteration:** Agencies will provide initial drafts of the guidelines and templates for review, with iterative revisions based on feedback.

* **Final Delivery:** All deliverables must be finalized and submitted in agreed-upon formats.

**6\. Evaluation Criteria**

* Demonstrated expertise in creating comprehensive brand guidelines and design templates.

* A portfolio that reflects consistency, creativity, and adherence to existing brand identities.

* Clarity in project management, including timelines and communication protocols.

* Competitive pricing as evidenced by the sourced quotes from design agencies in Vietnam.

* Ability to maintain and enhance our core UX focus while delivering visually compelling materials.

**7\. Budget**

* Agencies are expected to provide a detailed pricing breakdown with their quote.

* The overall budget will be determined based on a comparison of the three sourced quotes and the value proposition offered.

**8\. Submission Instructions**

* Please submit your proposal, including a design portfolio and a detailed quote, to \[Designated Contact/Email\].

* In your proposal, include case studies or examples where you have delivered similar projects, specifically highlighting any work with digital platforms and UX-centric designs.

* If applicable, outline how you would source and compare three quotes from other design agencies in Vietnam, or provide your competitive quote directly.
